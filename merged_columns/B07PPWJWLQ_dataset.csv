'B07PPWJWLQ','thick breathable comfortable socks for a bit oversized shoes','5.0 out of 5 stars','I was looking for thick  cotton breathable comfortable socks for a bit oversized shoes I got. This fit the bill like a glove. very comfortable on skin seems durable and has not changed color or size after wash. Even the elastic is exactly the same some of the other ones either shrink after a wash or give away after a few wash but not this one just stayed the same . This is a thicker variety of socks  so in case you have fitting shoes it might feel a bit uncomfortable'

'B07PPWJWLQ','Great Quality but Pricey Socks - A 4-Star Find!','4.0 out of 5 stars',"My name is Tejaswa Dogney, and I wanted to share my thoughts on the RANGER Men Crew Length Thick Cotton Terry Socks. I purchased these socks back in 2021 and am writing this review in 2023, after having used them for a couple of years.  First and foremost, let me highlight the positives or pros of these socks:  1. Exceptional Quality: The quality of these socks is truly outstanding. The thick cotton terry material ensures a soft and comfortable feel, making them perfect for long hours of wear. The durability has been impressive, as they have held up remarkably well even after regular use and numerous washes.  2. Excellent Cushioning: One of the standout features of these socks is their cushioning. The plush terry fabric provides excellent support and padding, making them ideal for activities that involve a lot of walking or standing. I have worn them during hiking trips and long walks, and they have kept my feet comfortable and protected.  3. Reliable Fit: These crew length socks offer a snug and secure fit, hugging the feet without feeling restrictive. The elastic band around the cuffs keeps them in place throughout the day, preventing any annoying slippage or bunching.  Now, let's move on to the cons or drawbacks of the RANGER Men Crew Length Thick Cotton Terry Socks:  1. Pricey: I must admit that the price of these socks is on the higher side. While they deliver excellent quality and comfort, they may not be the most budget-friendly option. However, considering their durability, they do provide good value for the money in the long run.  In conclusion, after two years of using the RANGER Men Crew Length Thick Cotton Terry Socks, I can confidently say that they are a great find with a few minor downsides. The exceptional quality, superior cushioning, and reliable fit make them a top choice for those seeking long-lasting and comfortable socks. Despite being slightly expensive, the durability justifies the investment.  I hope you find this review helpful in making an informed purchasing decision. Happy shopping!  Best regards, Tejaswa Dogney"
