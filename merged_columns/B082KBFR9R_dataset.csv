'B082KBFR9R','Fake Damascus knife','3.0 out of 5 stars',"This knife is not at all the original product. Moreover it's a Chinese product and hence can't be trusted. However, the knife has good sharpness and looks beautiful."
'B082KBFR9R','N/A','N/A','This knife is great! Really inexpensive and easy to sharpen. Has a great grip'
'B082KBFR9R','N/A','N/A','Good knife for the price! handle has a nice feel. Strong knife. Came on time. Overall very happy with this purchase.'

This isn't just a knife; it's a symphony in your kitchen. üéµüî™üçÖ"
'B082KBFR9R','N/A','N/A',"I'm so glad I bought this knife. Even though it wasn't expensive, it feels well-balanced and slices and chops with ease. Watch your fingers! It is very sharp and can make very thin slices."
'B082KBFR9R','N/A','N/A',Not too sharp but I use the sharpener... fine. But this rust bad. Man stay a way from this. Get the better set at costco and you'll be happier and return policy is the best.
'B082KBFR9R','N/A','N/A','Wasting my money'
'B082KBFR9R','N/A','N/A',"It's a good knife but it was only sharp the first few uses.. I still like it, ill just sharpen it every now and then"
'B082KBFR9R','N/A','N/A',"It seems my expectations were too high given the price I paid for this item. I do expect, however, at the very least to not receive an item that was clearly a factory second and should've been rejected for sale by the QC department. As shown in the picture you can clearly see a burr in the metal about halfway down the knife blade, rendering it all but useless. It appears to be a hot spot that occurred during the manufacturing process."
'B082KBFR9R','N/A','N/A','This is a great knife for the price. Sharp and I don‚Äôt have to cringe when the knife gets handled roughly. Use it for normal day to day cutting tasks.'
'B082KBFR9R','N/A','N/A','Very impressed that at this price point I actually received a sharp blade. It cut through my watermelon rind with minimal effort. The handle feels pleasant to hold. I bought a second one. I have not had it for long so I cannot grade durability but while it is light in weight it feels solid.'
'B082KBFR9R','N/A','N/A','The knife came with scuffs and marks was clearly not new. Even had a chip at the blade. Sent it right back'
'B082KBFR9R','N/A','N/A','Sharp!'
'B082KBFR9R','N/A','N/A',"I feel like the knife is hollow, there's no gravity, It's very light and difficult to cut"
'B082KBFR9R','N/A','N/A','Just too many reviews not a good quality'
'B082KBFR9R','N/A','N/A',"'When there was a big coupon for $10 a piece I bought one. Upon opening the box it is a good looking knife with a nice weight to it. It seems full tang with a great balance. But as I moved my finger along the cutting edge I felt a section in the belly was rough. Upon visual inspection closely it was indeed rough with clear grinding marks. Too bad I thought it defective sample must have been an exception. So I returned it for a replacement. A few days later the replacement arrived. Again in the belly the cutting edge was badly ground and only worse. It seems uneven pressure was applied during the grinding there were micro-teeth on the edge and they spread over the entire belly. It goes without saying this time I returned for a refund. It seems that the manufacturer had a defective batch that they just sold them at a deep discount without labeling them as ""irregular.""'"
'B082KBFR9R','N/A','N/A',"when it's under $8 price it's the best value no, this isn't the best and hard steel, but good enough for most work yes, you have to sharpen it more often vs real German High Carbon steel so don't expect a miracle for $8.00 or even below otherwise as a spare or for camping it's good enough"
'B082KBFR9R','N/A','N/A','Great knife and value'
'B082KBFR9R','N/A','N/A','I have purchased 4. I use one a lot. It‚Äôs still just as sharp.'
'B082KBFR9R','N/A','N/A',"I have small hands which makes finding a knife I can use a problem. This knife is so easy to use. I knew my other knives were dull and not the proper sizes, but I didn't really care. After using this knife, I DO CARE. Having the proper knife makes such a difference."
'B082KBFR9R','N/A','N/A','This knife is not only beautiful looking but also exceptionally sharp. I‚Äôd love it. I love the weight of it I like the feel of the handle everything was just perfect besides being a great price.'
'B082KBFR9R','N/A','N/A','The knife has a good feel and is very sharp.'
'B082KBFR9R','N/A','N/A','After 2 months of using it it lost its sharpness!'
'B082KBFR9R','N/A','N/A','Feels sharp but the pattern looks to be painted on. It arrived with the tip bent like it was dropped on it.'
'B082KBFR9R','N/A','N/A','works and handles nicely...takes and holds a good edge. Just be aware that the patterned blade is laser etched not due to heat treating in the traditional manner. Would buy again however. 8/20/23: wound up giving 1st one ordered to grandson who wants to be a chef...got good feedback so just ordered two more!'
'B082KBFR9R','N/A','N/A','Nice sharp knife'
'B082KBFR9R','N/A','N/A','I love this knife. It‚Äôs not only nice looking but it cuts so smoothly even through tough items.'
'B082KBFR9R','N/A','N/A','The holder it came in left black residue so obviously you have to clean it but be careful washing with this product. The blade slices through pretty much any cooking material (besides chocolate) with ease'
'B082KBFR9R','N/A','N/A','Comfortable to hold and nice design on the blade but best of all super sharp!'
'B082KBFR9R','N/A','N/A','Very nice knife but will lose its sharpness'
'B082KBFR9R','N/A','N/A','Great knife and really holds a sharp edge. Works well Highly recommended especially for the price.'
'B082KBFR9R','N/A','N/A','Great quality for the price!'
'B082KBFR9R','N/A','N/A',"It's sharp out of the package, going to leave a next review after I use it to cook"
'B082KBFR9R','N/A','N/A','This knife was $7 and it was really sharp and cut through everything like butter. I would recommend to anyone.'
'B082KBFR9R','N/A','N/A','For the price this knife is totally worth it. I recommend taking a chance on this knife when the price is under 10 bucks.'
'B082KBFR9R','N/A','N/A','Its a great knife for the price.'
'B082KBFR9R','N/A','N/A',I didn't realize how dull my other chefs knife was until I got this one. The blade is thin and very sharp and cuts through tomatoes with ease. Hoping it keeps its edge and can be trued up with sharpening.
'B082KBFR9R','N/A','N/A','It feels slightly cheap'
'B082KBFR9R','N/A','N/A',It's very attractive and sharp would make a great gift.
'B082KBFR9R','N/A','N/A',"I was very pleased with this knife. I purchased it on a lightening deal or coupon, one of the two and didn't have too high of expectations but it is really nice. Super sharp cut through a giant piece of meat like butter. Easy to hold on to. I do wish it was a 6 inch instead of an 8 but is just because my hands are small."
'B082KBFR9R','N/A','N/A','Sharp.'
'B082KBFR9R','N/A','N/A',"'love the look of the ""engraving"" and it\'s well built and has good balance.'"
'B082KBFR9R','N/A','N/A',It's not real Damascus. They laser etched a wavy pattern on it. Doesn't look anything like true Damascus. But it's still extra sharp. So if you would've told me I was getting a sharp knife that cuts well. And as a bonus we'll laser etch a pattern then fine.... But they lied.... But for 10$ it's good.
'B082KBFR9R','N/A','N/A',"I love this knife, my sister bought one and recommended it to me. For $14 or so dollars I had to try it. My Wusthof knife was on its last legs so I needed a replacement. I didn't want to purchase yet another expensive knife so I went with this one and I am glad I did. I use 1 knife for everything practically. I do have a very old bread serrated knife that I use for bread but I use this for everything else. I don't even use a paring knife so I just needed an overall knife and this is perfect."
'B082KBFR9R','N/A','N/A','The price is great if it is not sharp anymore I can replace it without thinking about how much I have paid'
'B082KBFR9R','N/A','N/A',"This is well crafted knife for its price. Very sturdy, and quite sharp. I am currently a culinary student and so far it is working out. I even dropped it on the floor and it didn't crack,, bend or break."
'B082KBFR9R','N/A','N/A','Looks great and cuts wonderful'
'B082KBFR9R','N/A','N/A','Amazon had this on flash sale and the price was super cheap. Decided to buy and so far it has performed great. Extremely sharp. Need to find some in smaller sizes.'
'B082KBFR9R','N/A','N/A','This knife is a winner! It is easy to hold and balance is great. You can cut as thin or thick as you want.'
'B082KBFR9R','N/A','N/A','Well built comfortable and very sharp.'
