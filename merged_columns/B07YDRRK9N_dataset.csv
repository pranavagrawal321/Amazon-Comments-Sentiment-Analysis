'B07YDRRK9N','N/A','N/A','Overpriced and unsuitable for use. Does not stretch well.'
'B07YDRRK9N','N/A','N/A','The tape is too small to be used for my projects.'
'B07YDRRK9N','N/A','N/A','I usually trust the Amazon basics brand. This time I was disappointed. This tape is made from extremely thin material with terrible adhesive. These Rolls only contain about half the normal amount of tape per roll and the tape is half as wide as a standard roll. I threw this in the trash immediately.'
