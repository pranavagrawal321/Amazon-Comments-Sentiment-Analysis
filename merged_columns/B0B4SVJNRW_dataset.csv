'B0B4SVJNRW','Flimsy plastic, slight screen bleed',"'4.0 out of 5 stars'Pros: Good picture quality Crisp image Height+tilt adjustable Looks premium Thin and modern design  Cons: -Single HDMI port -Bezel plastic is not of great quality, even -makes squicky noises if pressed at bottom Controls are hard for first timers -75hz is gimmick for non-gaming purpose -Speakers are okayish -Slight screen bleed is visible on top left. It's noticeable but only when using apps in dark mode. It wasn't a deal breaker so didn't apply for replacement. And after some research it is an issue found on all IPS panels.  Conclusion: Apart from minor screen bleed it is mostly an amazing monitor. If fits in your budget you can go for it. Colours are amazing and tons of customisation is available to set screen according to your test. Also quiet soft on the eyes."
