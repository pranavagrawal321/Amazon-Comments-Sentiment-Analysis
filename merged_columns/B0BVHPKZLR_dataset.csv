'B0BVHPKZLR','Not a product for Calling pepole.','3.0 out of 5 stars',Tozo is a very great company and has very good products & i am very satisfied with the Company customer support. I bought tozo t6 for 2600 and using this from last 3 months. in terms of Music & Bass quality it's amazing and i am totally satisfied with the product. It is very upto the mark. & fit of this product is absolutely fine. But if you're buying this product for Calling or Gaming purpose i would not suggest not to invest in this product. Better to go with Tozo T9 they're same in price but T9 has better noise cancellation.

'B0BVHPKZLR','Good earphones in budget but there is no matte black colour for these earphones','3.0 out of 5 stars',The earphones are good in this budget (i bought it for 2699 rs). My only disappointment is the lie of stating that they sell matte black color of this earphone.  THERE IS NO MATTE BLACK COLOUR OF THESE EARPHONES. They will send you only the simple black colour ones if you order matte black color. Even their own earphone box doesn't list any matte black color where it lists all available colors. This was a clear scam on their part. I took it up with Amazon Customer Care too but they didn't do anything about it except stating that a comlaint has been registered. I mean I could have ordered some other colour if i knew it would be just black.
'B0BVHPKZLR','Good product but expected more from it.','3.0 out of 5 stars','Overall the earbuds work well and have a long battery life and impressive Bluetooth range. However I have also started experiencing some issues.  First the earbuds are not ergonomic and can be uncomfortable to wear. None of the ear tips fit my ears properly.  Second the charging case looks cheap and the hinge is loose.  Third one of the earbuds does not charge properly unless I adjust it manually. It stays connected to my phone even when it is in the charging case. When I adjust it manually it starts charging and disconnects from my phone.  I bought these earbuds after reading many positive reviews but it seems like I got a defective pair.'
'B0BVHPKZLR','Sound quality','2.0 out of 5 stars','Everything was great until the sound quality of right earbud decreased to a noticeable extent that too in just 2 days...may be a manufacturing defect thanks to Amazon service and seller i returned it will order a new one again'

'B0BVHPKZLR','Highly Recommended','5.0 out of 5 stars',"I Really love these earphones they have excellent music quality, fit, noise insulation and build quality. These earphones are water proof and have good microphones however the only thing i would want to change about them is the fact that they lack usb c charging and fast charging. Overall they're good all rounders and i would highly recommend them."
'B0BVHPKZLR','What a wonderful ear buds','5.0 out of 5 stars',"I just can't believe the sound quality and ease of operation, I have Bose ear buds too, but it was not worth investing 18k on Bose, I loved Tozo and the price at which I got it is amazing. Thank you Amazon üëçüëçüëç"
