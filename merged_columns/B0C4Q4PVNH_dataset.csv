'B0C4Q4PVNH','Pillow nahi pocha hai','1.0 out of 5 stars','Not a pillow but a slightly upgraded version of pocha (wipe).  Thickness of this pocha is good enough for pocha but not for a pillow.  Softness is due to very less quantity of fill rather than due to the material.  Bakwaas product from Solimo i.e. Amazon.'
