'B0C768BBF5','Returning apple pencil','2.0 out of 5 stars',This apple pencil doesn't work with the iPad that I use I need a replace or exchange with apple pencil 1st generation
'B0C768BBF5','Bad quality Tip','1.0 out of 5 stars',"The tip worn out within a week of use. I used it without any screen protector, still it got worn out so quickly. I am replacing it. Bad product from apple. Why would I buy new tips Rs. 2000 that can't even last a week?"
'B0C768BBF5','Highly misleading Product headline','1.0 out of 5 stars','I find the product head line highlighly misleading and also shocking customer service from Amazon. I purchased an Ipad 2022 10 gen and this apple pencil 2.0 ( assuming this to be the latest best version) little did i know it is not compatible. Question to apple why they need to create is a different issue. When I called up Amazon for help they simply refused to consider my issue when I asked for replacement or return. I had to ultimate sell that to a second hand vendor at 50% loss the same day. When i contacted Apple they accepted this was a normal issue and they would have considered replacement if we purchased from them directly.'
'B0C768BBF5','Genuine product with 1 Year Apple Warranty','5.0 out of 5 stars','Firstly the Apple Pencil 2nd generation was delivered next day of my ordering (a day prior to the delivery date). Kudos to logistic team for an early delivery of the product.  I quickly cross-checked the Serial Number mentioned on the box in my Ipad pro settings and within the Apple Pencil nib. All three places the serial numbers matched.  Next I registered the pencil on Apple‚Äôs brand website and verified the product warranty of 1 year by Apple as mentioned in the warranty claim by the seller and Amazon to avoid hassle incase of any issues later. Since I had 7 days replacement available at hand with Amazon I could have replaced the product had Apple denied the product warranty. But since the product is genuine this step is not required. A big relief üôÇüëçüèΩ  Also I was pleasantly surprised to find that the pencil was manufactured recently in May 2023 (mentioned on the box). As the product was discounted I was skeptical to receive a 2022 manufactured product. Again a big thumbs up here üëçüèΩ  Overall a good experience and a steal deal to purchase this product on Amazon via Appario Retail (seller).'
'B0C768BBF5','Good product. Size bit small.','4.0 out of 5 stars','Product is good. Just the size is bit small.'
'B0C768BBF5','A perfect combination with the ipad','5.0 out of 5 stars','I love the fact that this 2nd gen pencil is chargeable by attaching it to the ipad itself comparing to the old one. It is very smootch in drawing too. It was worth the money. Btw you get cheaper here too compare to other stores.'
'B0C768BBF5','Not working with my ipad','1.0 out of 5 stars',They doesn't return my apple pencil and its don't work with my ipad

'B0C768BBF5','Draining charge','4.0 out of 5 stars','Draining charge even without using the pencil to zeroüòëidk whether is there any prblm with the pencil can anyone kindly clear my doubt and what to do further'
'B0C768BBF5','Awesome','5.0 out of 5 stars','Using the pencil to write the review.'
'B0C768BBF5','The best tablet drawing stylus that money can buy!','5.0 out of 5 stars',"This is my second Apple pencil. The first one died when I accidentally dropped it on my marble floor. This was my fault, not Apple's; but be careful not to drop the Apple pencil. It is subject to injury or death if dropped. Otherwise, its performance with my Apple iPad Pro is flawless."
'B0C768BBF5',You don't need any review!,'5.0 out of 5 stars',"The media could not be loaded. This is an Apple pencil for apple ipad Air5(in my case). It's the best of the best yet overpriced thing like any other apple product. That sums up everything in one line.  Wanna know more?! Ok fine, yeah it has a good balanced weight, matte finish body with hard rubber tip. Snaps magnetically to the side in both orientation, holds the charge for about 2-3hours of continuous usage and obviously it has no competitor in terms of optimization.  VERDICT: If you make regular notes or draw like me, then go for it. It would be a good investment in the long run however, if you just want another apple accessory just to show off then its basically meaningless and unworthy."
'B0C768BBF5','The best','5.0 out of 5 stars','It‚Äôs serves the purpose. A good buy from Amazon'
'B0C768BBF5','Nice accessory','5.0 out of 5 stars','If you want to tap the maximum potential of an ipad and want to use it as an artist or for note taking then this device is the accessory of choice for you.
