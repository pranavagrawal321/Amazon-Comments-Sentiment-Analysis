'B07589GQRL','single ply bad quality napkins','1.0 out of 5 stars','The napkins are rough and not good absorbent. One napkin would not suffice a single requirement and thus end up using the entire pack a lot earlier than expected. Several other brands such as origami white knight provide good quality napkins in similar price range. i do not recommend these.'

'B07589GQRL','Awful','1.0 out of 5 stars','I bought these napkins fr my home and was most disappointed because of the false claim of being ‚Äúsoft‚Äù They are far away from being soft!! They are the ‚Äúcrispy‚Äù rough type cheap quality napkins and quite useless with absorption as well Definitely a bad choice and will never make the mistake of getting these again.'
