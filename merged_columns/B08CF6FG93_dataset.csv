'B08CF6FG93','Very nice and quality product from TH on Amazon.','4.0 out of 5 stars',"'Delivered after 5 days. Came packed in a nice TH box along with TH logo printed fabric bag (that can be used to keep other stuff too) . Wearing this same belt for last 2 years hence ordered again. Elegant look and very fine finish. The leather is matte finished (brown) and is adequatly soft. Size ""S"" is bit smaller to waist size - 35inch and hence needed some extra holes and modification to fit. (Would have ordered a bigger size). Overall length of leather - 41inch First hole at 32 inch Last hole at 37 inch With six holes @ 1 inch. Check the size carefully before ordering.'"
