'B0825W7LP8','Pros and cons','4.0 out of 5 stars',Pros : 1. Best at this price 2. Blends well 3. Smooth 4. Dark and vibrant shades 5. So many shades  Cons : 1. Hard to blends (but if you're able to find the method to blend it then it'll blend smoothly) 2. Don't sharp to much bcz it'll break the leads ( soft tips) 3. So many useless shades ( more than 10+ shades are useless) 4. Idk the lead type I guess it's classics so it doesn't work with other brands colors like if your black or white color finished then you need to buy the original spare bcz this is not gonna with other's colour.

'B0825W7LP8','Good but Overpriced and poorly packed.','3.0 out of 5 stars','A bit pricey! Pencils are quite good but it should be around 200-250/- for the pack. The pack of the product (not the parcel) is very poor. After removing all the pencils it takes a lot of effort to put them inside the box and the quality of the box is also very cheap.'
'B0825W7LP8','Pencil tips were broken for few of the pencils','2.0 out of 5 stars','I did a replacement of this product but the second time also the pencil tips were broken. Now my kids is not allowing me to replace again as he wants to use them so we are sharpening the pencils and using them. I am yet to use the pencils but from the looks the pencils look good. If you are looking to buy this product dont show it to your kid until you receive a good product with the tips intact.'
'B0825W7LP8','Good with lot of improvement areas.','3.0 out of 5 stars',"I was not happy with the packaging at all. The package could include a two- wholed sharper and an eraser which I think Fabercastle did provide earlier. Also, I find the colour pencils too bright which makes me doubt it it's really a Fabercastle product."

'B0825W7LP8','Bad lead','2.0 out of 5 stars','This is what happened after one usage. The lead is sooooo cheaply made that that is consistently breaks as you are sharpening the pencil. I was completing a project with this pink color and it devoured my neon pink'
