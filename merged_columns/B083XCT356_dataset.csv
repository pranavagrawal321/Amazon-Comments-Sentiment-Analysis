'B083XCT356','Nice snug good quality belts','5.0 out of 5 stars',"These belts are exactly as shown in the product photos. Go ahead and buy them. They are value for money, and excellent quality. I just wish they were longer, as I had purchased these belts for an old relative who has a bigger waist size.
