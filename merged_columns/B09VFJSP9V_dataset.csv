'B09VFJSP9V',It is what it is. There isn't a better product at least for now.,'5.0 out of 5 stars',"I bought it as we friends used to play poker very often. The plastic drawer has to have a brim or edge or should be slant, so that when one pulls it out, the cards don't fall in the well.  It's not an extraordinary device. That's all I can say."
