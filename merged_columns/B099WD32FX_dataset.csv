'B099WD32FX','Busted out of the box','1.0 out of 5 stars',"Straight out of the box, none of the outlets other than the first one works. I.e. 3 out of the 4 are busted on a brand new piece.

'B099WD32FX','Price, socket, individual switch 5m long wire''5.0 out of 5 stars''Bought for 569 good features like there is dedicated switch for each socket. Length of the wire is best it‚Äôs 5 meter long. And quality of wire and board is also good. Writing review after around 15 days usage.  Cons: The socket seems bit big as per plug size. When I put my apple phone charger in socket it is bit somewhat loose. But may be being bit loose it is protecting the plug by not breaking it . Appearance can bi bit better.  Highly recommended.'
