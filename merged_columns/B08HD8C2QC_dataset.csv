'B08HD8C2QC','Read the Review','4.0 out of 5 stars',"Firstly, i would like to say that for the first few days of using the pillow I really got neck pain which I didnot have before. So I stopped using it under my neck and instead put it next to me and put my arm in it and slept and you won't believe when I say I got the best sleep. Thank you Pillow for teaching me how to sleep without a pillow. I liked the product."
