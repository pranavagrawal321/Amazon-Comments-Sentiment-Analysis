'B07LC4CWQF','Better than orginal scotch tape for walls','3.0 out of 5 stars',"Its an ok product with its adhesion being a little less than the normal scotch tape. It is a bit better than the normal one for walls but is still not totally wall safe, atleast for the paint of my house. Another thing which I didn't like is that it is open from the back as you can see in the picture. But I am not totally sure whether this is how it is supposed to be ðŸ˜… though the packaging was brand new."
'B07LC4CWQF','useful for birthday party stuffs','5.0 out of 5 stars','Useful for birthday party decorations on newly painted houses.'
'B07LC4CWQF','Not worth it','2.0 out of 5 stars',I used this tape to stick wall poster and by evening they keep falling down. Its adhesive power is very poor and can't even hold a piece of paper. It is easy to remove and do not leave stains on wall. It is not transparent and kind of translucent white color. I did not fulfill my purpose and was total waste of money
'B07LC4CWQF','Magic wonderful','5.0 out of 5 stars','Product delivery was quick and received as described. The packaging was good and value for money.'
'B07LC4CWQF',Didn't work on wallpaper,'1.0 out of 5 stars',"Had ordered this specifically to fix some posters onto a wallpaper-covered wall, didn't work at all. Adhesion came off after 2 mins or so itself."
'B07LC4CWQF','Overpriced.','3.0 out of 5 stars','Very much overpriced.'
'B07LC4CWQF','might as well have gotten off brand scotch tape','1.0 out of 5 stars',"This tape had one job: to hold up some silly little sheets of paper on a wall. It failed miserably though. If you searching for the equivalent of a less sticky original scotch tape for some reason, then go ahead and buy it. Honestly though, the most this tape can hold up is half an A4 size sheet of printing paper. Otherwise it's not gonna hold up. Def wouldn't buy again"

'B07LC4CWQF','Works great','5.0 out of 5 stars','I bought this tape to decorate the wall with my artworks . The adhesion is not too strong but enough to hold my paintings and protect the wall paint. If anyone reading this wants to checkout my art page on insta.. my username is @artbysumee'

'B07LC4CWQF','Not sticky enough , cannot hold anything more than a few grams.','1.0 out of 5 stars''This is a waste of money. The packaging inside the delivery bag was partly open.

'B07LC4CWQF','Good go for it','5.0 out of 5 stars','It is a plastic version on paper tape but Worth it.'
'B07LC4CWQF','Perfect for walls','5.0 out of 5 stars',The media could not be loaded. I stuck LED lights on top of my roof with this tape and it worked wonders. I also set up a Christmas tree made of LED lights on the wall and it also stuck and stayed really well. Absolutely recommend for wall used and doesn't leave any stick stains on the wall.
'B07LC4CWQF','Adhesiveness should be better and plastic case should be on both sides','3.0 out of 5 stars','For sticking pictures on wall. The plastic casing is usually there on both sides for easy manipulation. Here or was only on one side. Adhesion could be slightly better.'
