'B0BLZB9CTV','Doesnâ€™t Fit well','1.0 out of 5 stars','This shorts have a major fit issue the size mentioned runs smaller. It is tight for the hip and overall is fitt Is also very odd. It will look tight on the from and loose on the rear. The fabric is ok and very light. Good for running but not for everyday use. Looks like a cheap copy of NIKE.  Overall a big no to buy this.'
