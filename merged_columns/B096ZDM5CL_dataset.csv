'B096ZDM5CL','Good Product','4.0 out of 5 stars',I recieved the bottles just as it was shown in the images. Safe and well packed. It is worth our price but I only wish the corks were of better quality. I couldn't open two bottles because of them so it'd be great if the quality of the corks could be improved.

'B096ZDM5CL','the cork does not come out of the bottle','2.0 out of 5 stars','The bottle is good and well packed but of no use as the seller packed the cork so tightly it does not come out of the bottle. when I put pressure to take it out it started too crumble. More than half of the 60 bottles are now wasted.'
