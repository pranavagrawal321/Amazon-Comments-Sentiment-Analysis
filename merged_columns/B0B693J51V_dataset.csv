'B0B693J51V','Not of Arrow Quality','1.0 out of 5 stars','Blazer was of very thin cloth. Not like a Blazer . It is just a show coat . Back is very thin. It will get crushed as u will sit on sofa or Car seat.  Quality of cloth is also very poor. I never came across such product from Arrow Brand ever .  In my opinion : not a worth to buy'
