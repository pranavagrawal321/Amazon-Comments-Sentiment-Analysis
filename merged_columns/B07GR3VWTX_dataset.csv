'B07GR3VWTX','Smooth but bleeds to the back-side of standard thickness paper.','3.0 out of 5 stars',"If you are a working professional and only need a pen to sign or occasionally jot down things here and there, this pen may be fine. It's definitely very smooth to write with and looks stylish to boot. If you are however, a student and have to write pages at a time, do not opt for this. I made the mistake of using this (and cello's Ivory roller pen) for the first time during an exam and it was all fine and good until I turned the page over. To my horror, the ink had bleed all over to the other side. Nasty piece of work. Switched to the roller pen thereafter, but that was even worse. Luckily I also had a ratty old pen with me so that saved the day. I suppose I'll be using these for one-off signatures in the future; or if I happen to be writing on some extra thick paper."

'B07GR3VWTX','The best one!','5.0 out of 5 stars',I've been writing with many roller ball pens and this is one of the best I've ever used. The pen looks more premium than its price and its weight is just perfect! The writing experience it gives is just flawless.
