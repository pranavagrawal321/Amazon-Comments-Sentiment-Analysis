'B0B11XYDQ4','Thin, too thin," but slightly bigger than A4 size''3.0 out of 5 stars'It's paper-thin. So not sure how long it will last. And given that it costs some Rs 360 for 10 pieces, making it 36 rupees apiece, the folders certainly don't come that cheap. But it surely is slightly bigger than A4 size, so laminated certificates will go in, i guess"
