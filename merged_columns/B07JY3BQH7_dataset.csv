'B07JY3BQH7','So far, so good',"'4.0 out of 5 stars'Provides extra support for my back in a chair. Wasn't expecting them to be so big, but they fit the chair fine. My chair is indoors. Not expecting fading from sunlight."

'B07JY3BQH7','N/A','N/A','Received cushions and was very pleased with how they felt and what they looked like. They are very comfortable and would have looked great on my rocking chairs. Unfortunately they are a little bigger than I need so will have to send them back :-('
'B07JY3BQH7','N/A','N/A','Patio deck chairs'
'B07JY3BQH7','N/A','N/A','These already started to fade after being outside a few months so that was disappointing. But very comfortable.'
'B07JY3BQH7','N/A','N/A','Not as thick as advertised. Faded very quickly.'
'B07JY3BQH7','N/A','N/A','The pads faded very quickly from black to a rust color'
'B07JY3BQH7','N/A','N/A',These are such rubbish. The color faded to a hideous rust color within the first month. What a disappointment. I'll be returning them and they spraying the new ones with some kind of color/sun guard.
'B07JY3BQH7','N/A','N/A','The cushions we’re supposed to be fade resistant and water resistant. After the first week the color black had turned to brown it faded and was not even out in full sun. And the cushions were wet even just by the dew and not even rain .'
'B07JY3BQH7','N/A','N/A',"I haven't had them long enough to comment on durability, but they seem to shed water and are comfy"
'B07JY3BQH7','N/A','N/A','This is after three days in the sun! Obviously these are NOT UV protective as described! Extremely disappointed- because I ABSOLUTELY LOVE this pattern!!! However I do need to return them- because they will NOT stay black!'
'B07JY3BQH7','N/A','N/A','Goes well with my black patio set.'
'B07JY3BQH7','N/A','N/A','These are very nice. I love the pattern. We have black metal patio furniture and these cushions look really good with them. Yes they do change color if in direct sun. They go from black and white to a kind of nice brick and white color (which I kind of like better honestly :) So turned out good. They are well made also. Priced fairly. :)'
'B07JY3BQH7','N/A','N/A','Faded in 2 days'
'B07JY3BQH7','N/A','N/A','These pillows were under the sun one day and their color totally faded. Would not recommend them at all!'
'B07JY3BQH7','N/A','N/A',Quality appears to be good. I've only had this for a month but it appears to be holding up just fine in hot Oklahoma weather. Very attractive black and white design. Purchased a set of 2 to use on a metal glider and they work fine.
'B07JY3BQH7','N/A','N/A',We bought four of these. Two were tied on our porch bench and the black pattern looked nice. They remain comfortable to sit on. We were thankful that the homeless porch pirates here in Portland didn't take them before we could enjoy them. However yesterday and some two weeks after placing them outside in limited direct sun the cushions have faded from black to brown.
'B07JY3BQH7','N/A','N/A','I would have given these cushions a -1 star rating if offered. They’re pictured as a black paisley type design and as patio chair cushions. After just a few days in the sun the black faded to maroon. These cushions have never seen rain. Only sun and quickly changed from black to maroon. Very disappointing.'
'B07JY3BQH7','N/A','N/A','This is the fading that occurred in just 24 hours on the chairs I bought them for. They also soak in a lot of water from your bathing suit when you sit on them. I’ll go back to see whether I missed something in the product description but these aren’t acceptable for outdoor use in direct sunlight or around the pool. They are very comfortable and feel durable (other than the dyes used).'
'B07JY3BQH7','N/A','N/A',love the pattern but the black turned to dull brownish reddish in just a few days. can't justify for the price. will be returning.
'B07JY3BQH7','N/A','N/A','These fit my Adirondack rocking chairs perfectly. They have ties to secure and added just the right padding to the chair to be comfortable without making me sit too high up. Highly recommend'
'B07JY3BQH7','N/A','N/A',I bought these to replace cushions on front porch. Much thinner than I expected. Colors fade really fast! Since I wasn't willing to pay more I guess they'll do. May just try to make my own next time!
'B07JY3BQH7','N/A','N/A','Very flat. Not Comfortable at all'
'B07JY3BQH7','N/A','N/A','these cushions are nice looking but not very cushy'
'B07JY3BQH7','N/A','N/A','Good quality and beautiful.'
'B07JY3BQH7','N/A','N/A','Dislike they look very comfortable online but very cheap and no cushion whatsoever. Stay away'
