'B0877BMB9X','Product Quality','1.0 out of 5 stars','Extremely flimsy  cannot do more than a week of basic cleaning. Maybe i had the wrong expectation from the product based on other experiences.'
'B0877BMB9X','More useful than I expected','5.0 out of 5 stars','This is a such a multipurpose cleaner. The fact that u can just take out the microfiber towel n wash it and even use any other towel is even better!'
'B0877BMB9X','It cleans the surface in one sweep.','5.0 out of 5 stars','It traps all dust and dirt particles in itshelf and cleaning the mop cloth is also very easy. You can use any microfiber cloth of similar size with it.'

'B0877BMB9X','Not very useful','2.0 out of 5 stars','Not very useful as head gets tilted every time'
'B0877BMB9X','Not for wet cleaning','2.0 out of 5 stars',"Rode is very flimsy and won't last. After first usage top of the rode came off and can't be put back. Microfiber cloth sticks to the floor and mop board just flips every time you trying to wipe floor. Replacement of cloth to a piece of old towel solves this issue. Overall quite useless mop for wet cleaning, wouldn't buy again"
'B0877BMB9X','Very cumbersome','3.0 out of 5 stars','Removing the micro fibre cloth every time and clipping it is very cumbersome and the stock is slightly short tall people will have to bend.'
'B0877BMB9X','Worst product ever','1.0 out of 5 stars',"The product is totally waste. The handle is not sturdy enough to hold and mop. The head of the mop doesn't move at all when we try to clean the floor. If I ever think of a mop, pls don't buy it. mine is simply sitting in the house as they don't have returns option also."

'B0877BMB9X','Broken in 1st month','2.0 out of 5 stars','Broken in first month they should increase built quality'
'B0877BMB9X','Waste of money','1.0 out of 5 stars',It's not worth of 570. 100-150 is best price. Very small in size. Only works for tiney rooms. Not for regular size rooms.
'B0877BMB9X','Good','5.0 out of 5 stars',It's sturdy and has a clasp mechanism so that mop cloth can be removed and cleaned

'B0877BMB9X','Useless product','2.0 out of 5 stars','Poor quality.'
'B0877BMB9X','good buy.','5.0 out of 5 stars','the handlebar is strong and sturdy. the mob paid is of microfiber to pickup dust easily. overall a good product.'
'B0877BMB9X','Only for baby use','1.0 out of 5 stars',Within 45 days and less than 10 times used the rod got break down from the middle.At the time of purchase it was six months warranty but currently it's not showing üò°üò†ü§¨
'B0877BMB9X','Bad product','1.0 out of 5 stars','The quality of the rod is bad. It bends after 5 times use. Not good for daily use. Will not purchase it again'
'B0877BMB9X','Flimsy system, cannot do the work.','1.0 out of 5 stars''The only thing good about it is the micro-fibre cloth and the attachment system. But the quality of the product is very poor. The rod bends if you try wet mopping even in dry mopping it need a lot of strength to keep the rod from breaking. I am sure the system will come apart in another 10 days Ive used it for 3 days now. With such good technique of holding the cloth they only had to work on the strength. But alas. Its a waste of money.'
'B0877BMB9X','Good in some dry conditions','3.0 out of 5 stars','Unable to use in home routine as zadu. It does broom away minute dust. But required more physical skill.'
'B0877BMB9X','Fragile','2.0 out of 5 stars',"Product delivered on time üëç Packaging was ok üëç Overpriced ... should have been below rs 300/- considering the built quality. Built quality is not upto the mark ,Might break if used for wet mopping but dust mopping is done well thanks to the microfiber cloth .(The part for hanging the product came off while using the product was able to put it back ) This product can be used just to keep dust off on daily basis after a tharough vaccum cleaning or wet mopping of the floor until the next , NOT an alternative to broom to do daily heavy cleaning of room. Product should be used with care . Only positive is the microfiber cloth can be replaced after its worn off with old bathing towel or even another microfiber towel ( don't have to invest again for the refill microfiber as In other mops ) .  ."
'B0877BMB9X','Nice','5.0 out of 5 stars','It is good to have removable cloth best one'
'B0877BMB9X','Poorly designed','1.0 out of 5 stars',The media could not be loaded. The fabric's friction and lose joint which has no sustainable strength makes it impossible to reverse mop.
'B0877BMB9X',Its not so good you can't operate forward and backward position,'1.0 out of 5 stars','Holding rod is good finishing is good but not as accepted'
'B0877BMB9X','Worst Weak Product','1.0 out of 5 stars','Bought it 2 times but it broke both times from middle. At 1st instant i had thought its defective piece. However when it broke 2nd time i was assured that the quality itself is poor.'
'B0877BMB9X','Good for cleaning.but poor build quality..','3.0 out of 5 stars','Nice for cleaning..but Poor build quality.'
'B0877BMB9X','Poor quality - rod breaks, screws come off','3.0 out of 5 stars''Like some others I too noticed that these are not built strong enough for the job. Either the screws break / come off or the rod gives way under pressure and bends / breaks. It is not rocket science to manufacture this product wonder why no manufacturer is able to make it well. Tried a few others then thought this one being an Amazon product would be trust worthy but it is as bad.'
