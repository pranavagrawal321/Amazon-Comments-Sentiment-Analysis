'B07CXP4Q4P','Okay but not the best','3.0 out of 5 stars',I have put up pictures of features/flaws that are not visible in catalogue pictures (Though from other customers' pictures it is pretty clear what the product is like)  1. The stitching isn't smooth at some places 2. The eyes are very different from catalogue pictures. 3. The babies are stitched to the elephant and not detachable.  Good things: 1. The colour matches the catalogue pictures 2. Not very soft but still good. 3. Economic price
