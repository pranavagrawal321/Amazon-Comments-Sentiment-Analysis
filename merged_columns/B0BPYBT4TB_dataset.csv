'B0BPYBT4TB','Value for money desk','5.0 out of 5 stars',"I don't know what other people expect at this price point and why the unhappy faces; not like you are paying INR 10k+ for this.  My experience has been very good so far right from the delivery, packaging and assembly. Yes, assembly takes some time and 2 sets of hands but nothing too difficult and should be done in about 45 mins.  Everything needed is included in the package except a screwdriver. I'd recommend using a screw gun for faster installation, but be careful as a little extra twist and the material cracks.  The desk looks great and I have no problem pulling my chair close to it while seated and still having enough leg space.  It's not extremely sturdy but not shaky either. It's a good looking functional product if you know what to expect from it, especially keeping in mind what you paid for it :)"
'B0BPYBT4TB','Table not Sturdy. Table wiggles even if you are writing something on it.','2.0 out of 5 stars','Table as I said very unstable and also has sharp corners which is a matter of discomfort.

'B0BPYBT4TB','Delicate - Worth the Money','4.0 out of 5 stars',The table looks really cool however it's pretty delicate. We cannot put heavy stuff on it. For 2600 it's worth it.

'B0BPYBT4TB','Value for money. Good looking. Sturdy','5.0 out of 5 stars',"A value for money table. Go for it if you are looking for a study table which is good looking and made of good material. The table is sturdy, doesn't wobbles. There is an ample amount of space on it, you can easily set up a pc on it, or any type of stop you want. It also has a lower shelf in which you can keep some books, or a cpu. Package was delivered on time and was packed really well. No sign of damage was there. You have to assemble it by yourself, which is quite time taking. Everything is provided inside the box for easy setup. Overall the product quality is good. I bought the white colour which looks aesthetically good as well."
