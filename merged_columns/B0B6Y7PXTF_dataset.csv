'B0B6Y7PXTF','Good','5.0 out of 5 stars','Ok i bought this product and i m quiet satisfied with it.. bought all three product together..ok now i will tell u what to do to get full benifit out of it first atleast go for oiling 2-3 hr or night prior the shampoo also comb before shampooing will give u idea how much hair u been loosing on dry combing and shampooing... second wash with shampoo after diluting it else u get rough hair... third before conditioner squeeze all excess water this conditioner can make u loose hair but detangled it meraculously.. fourth step must to do to get bestest result use either loreal serum or livon dont skip and in the night just apply the night cream on the length.... follow these step and u will get amazing result and if you skip any of it u will get rough hair..... so yep go for it and their claim for 72 hr moisture lock gets true if u follow the above steps'
'B0B6Y7PXTF','Not worth the hype','3.0 out of 5 stars',Don't go by all the charm it has received. Is a suphate based shampoo that does nothing to retain moisture as it claims instead is taking away my hair colour and shine. The shampoo feel doesn't even last a day. Very disappointing!
'B0B6Y7PXTF','Shampoo is ok','3.0 out of 5 stars',"I used khadi bhringaraj shampoo that made my hair so dry. So I switched to this shampoo, it hydrates the hair very well in 1or 2 washes.

'B0B6Y7PXTF','Gives elegant shine','4.0 out of 5 stars',It's really amazing and gives a beautiful and elegant shine ... But after use this I meet up with little bit hairfall... Otherwise it's really good if yours hair is curly or wavy then it's highly recommended you..
