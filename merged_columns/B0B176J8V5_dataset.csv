'B0B176J8V5','Poor quality','2.0 out of 5 stars','Leak bottle'
'B0B176J8V5','Not durable because of poor engineering design','1.0 out of 5 stars',"The bottle has its bottom pasted to upright cylinder and not made up of a single Steel sheet. Hence it defeats the purpose of buying a sturdy rugged steel bottle just when the bottle drops once or twice. I bought 3 bottles, one of which got leakage at one drop only and other threw out it's complete bottom plate on similar encounter. So yes, if you can handle with care it's perfect to save some money but just take care not allow even a single slip from hands."
'B0B176J8V5','Lightweight and classy','4.0 out of 5 stars',"I already have a Milton thermkflask but it's too heavy to carry to ky college everyday.  This bottle solves that problem, it has premium and classy look, it's very sturdy too.  It has a very small dent on the bottom which is not a huge problem but sometimes when i try to open the cap (the cap comprises of two different layers) the upper layer comes off, again it's not much of a problem, i just need to put it back in and open it again but i really wish i didn't have to.  It fits perfectly into my bottle slot in the bag, the stainless steel colour doesn't fade. It's not an insulated flask so it won't keep your drinks hot or cold but that's already mentioned by the seller"
