'B00N469044','The best soap in the Indian market.','5.0 out of 5 stars',"I've been using this soap for many years now, and I couldn't be happier. What I particularly love about it is the strong smell which your body gives out after you've had a bath with this soap. You actually feel clean, and you give that impression to others too. Also, since it is very dry, it's particularly good for oily skin like mine."
