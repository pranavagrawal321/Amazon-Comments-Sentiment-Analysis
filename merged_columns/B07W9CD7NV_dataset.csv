'B07W9CD7NV','MADE IN INDIA ? IF SO THUMBS UP TO THE MANUFACTURER , SELLER & AMAZON !','5.0 out of 5 stars''Product Analysis : 1) Item arrived in neatly packed box with proper Tax Invoice ( a rare phenomemon nowadays ) . Seller gets full marks ! 2) Product Packaging - Excellently packed in a sturdy cute little pilfer proof PET jar with a seal akin to that of beer cans & a snugly fitting plastic lid  aimed at fastidious DIYers who find utility in every used material. 3) THE PRODUCT - Is definitely non magnetic STAINLESS STEEL  test says so ! Well built  pukka 1& 1/2 inches = 38 mm X 8  quantity mentioned 100pcs. but on counting found 101 Pcs. ! Workmanship satisfying . THE IMPRESSION : Stainless Steel screws are always the preferred material for places prone to attract saline air  for durable furnitures & fixtures & for being very obstinate to any kind of deformation whether inflicted or otherwise ! I have used SS screws extensively for my bespoke made heavy Sheesham wood furniture also SS screws are always better performers considering their cost in the long run compared to steel screws . These PHILIPS HEAD CSK SS Screws are ideal for furniture & fixtures which are intended to have a smooth surface suitable for easy cleaning . The concept is new in India IMO hence comparative cost in retail market may be verified  but then you better have a knock on your door from the AMAZON delivery asociate than to risk your health by visiting a far town to collect such material & be accosted by COVID 19 !'
'B07W9CD7NV','Misleading write up','2.0 out of 5 stars','The picture seems to indicate that there are 3 different size screws. The table on the next page also shows 7-8 different size screws with 8 in each size. But all screws are of only one size. This is misleading description'
'B07W9CD7NV','Spider stainless steel screw.','5.0 out of 5 stars','Very good and sturdy screw. Pure SS.'
