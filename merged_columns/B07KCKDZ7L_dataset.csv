'B07KCKDZ7L','Go for it!','5.0 out of 5 stars',"1) Unlike other pens, this gives you a grip to hold on to that makes it more comfortable to write with. 2) It does not leak through the page. 3) Worth the price. 4) Perfect for daily use and student use. 5) It gives you 20 blue pens and 5 black pens. 6) The only thing I didn't like about this is the ink gets over within a week if used a lot. Overall, it is worth your money! Go for it!"

'B07KCKDZ7L',Around 60 to 70 % don't write good quality,'2.0 out of 5 stars','Not good to buy full box if buying for personal use. After some time the pens you pick out do not have good flow of ink when you write.'
'B07KCKDZ7L','Good but not okay','3.0 out of 5 stars',"They do not give 25 Gel Pen instead 20 Blue Gel and 5 Black Pen. A person who needs just Blue Gel doesn't require Black Gel. It's a clear case of bundling. Even though it is the cheapest pen for this design language, it is simply not worth the price for students. I recommend buying Cello's Aqua Gel."
