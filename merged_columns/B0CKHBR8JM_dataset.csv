'B0CKHBR8JM','faulty product','1.0 out of 5 stars','The pump is not working and no content is coming out. Waste of 5000 Rs'
'B0CKHBR8JM','NOT FOR INDIAN SKIN','1.0 out of 5 stars','Guys don‚Äôt waste your money this sunscreen is not suitable for Indian skin you will look like a clown. Everyone will notice that you have applied some cream. I‚Äôm light skinned and I could still see the white cast it leaves on my skin. Also not worth for quantity you get with that price. STRICT NO!!'

'B0CKHBR8JM','Good','4.0 out of 5 stars','Good'
'B0CKHBR8JM','N/A','N/A',This is the product that my dermatologist recommended. I'm very happy with it. I've never spent this much on a face cream but I need upf protection. It goes on easily and it doesn't feel heavy. I don't ook like I'm wearing sunscreen. It can be irritating to the eyes however so careful not to get it too close or to rub your eyes when wearing.
'B0CKHBR8JM','N/A','N/A',"I purchased this and the pump didn't work, so it set up to return it. When I went to return it suddenly the pump worked again, so I kept it. 4 days later it won't work again and I've missed the return window"
'B0CKHBR8JM','N/A','N/A',"I have used this product for years, and I really love it! It pairs perfectly with whatever moisturizer the weather calls for, and it always protects my skin from the sun. I used to work at a medspa, and this was one of our top sellers. It's a great product at a good price point, and I plan to keep it stocked at home for me and my kids to use regularly."
'B0CKHBR8JM','N/A','N/A','Lo he estado usando por un mes y es s√∫per ligero no se siente nada grasos y amo que no tenga frangancias que irriten la piel lo recomiendo much√≠simo.'
'B0CKHBR8JM','N/A','N/A',"Early 50's parched skin, very sun sensitive to redness from the sun and hyperpigmentation! Also super sensitive to pretty much any ingredient there is anymore in anything! My favorite Image 50 spf changed their formula and it nows goes on like elmer's glue and stays thick and accentuates every crinkle in your face. I've spent a year looking for a replacement. This is normal consistency, rubs in nicely, no white cast, and provides moisture as well and will allow me to apply bare minerals powders over top smoothly and without splotches. No irritation. Done! It's not cheap but oh well. Sacrifice that for how well it seems to be performing!"
'B0CKHBR8JM','N/A','N/A',"I love this product when I can get it out of the bottle. Every other bottle I buy is faulty and the pump mechanism doesn't work, so the bottle is full and I can't get any out of it. There is no way to push from the bottom without destroying the bottle."
'B0CKHBR8JM','N/A','N/A','Product is great but now I can‚Äôt get any of it out. Expensive product in a bad pump. Extremely disappointed.'
'B0CKHBR8JM','N/A','N/A','Came broken with half of the contents missing. Product is good though'
'B0CKHBR8JM','N/A','N/A',"This truly is the best moisturizing face sunscreen product out there. My husband's dermatologist recommended this clear one for him, and I tried the tinted. Both are far better than any other similar products we've tried. It is so smooth and easy to spread. It's super lightweight and leaves absolutely no residue. It absorbs quickly and moistures well. He uses this as his morning moisturizer and sun protection, which does an excellent job of protecting again sun damage. Yes, it's more expensive than the standard brands, but it's worth it for a healthy, clean product. So pleased."
'B0CKHBR8JM','N/A','N/A','Goes on easily and disappears. Reduces tanning or burning. No strong odor. My dermatologist recommended it.'
'B0CKHBR8JM','N/A','N/A',I've been using this product for years and its a wonderful skin sunscreen. I highly recommend the elta MD sunscreen
'B0CKHBR8JM','N/A','N/A','The media could not be loaded. This is so perfect. Never broke me out!! I have to be careful with new products but it was so good. Wear on top of and under makeup. Try to let sit five minutes before makeup and after skincare. My husband even really really loved this for surfing! Worth the price if you can afford it.'
'B0CKHBR8JM','N/A','N/A','The media could not be loaded. La entrega r√°pida y al parecer es producto original pero el dispensador est√° da√±ado y no sale nada'
'B0CKHBR8JM','N/A','N/A','I love this product and have been using it as my daily sunscreen for a few years. This supplier sent me a defective item with a broken pump. No sunscreen comes out so I could not use any of the product and had to toss the whole thing. I hope I will be refunded or sent a replacement.'
'B0CKHBR8JM','N/A','N/A','Muy bueno!'
'B0CKHBR8JM','N/A','N/A','Love this sunscreen. Goes on smoothly not greasy or oily. Can use as a moisturizer'
'B0CKHBR8JM','N/A','N/A','I am very disappointed in relation to what I received I bought the product and received a bottle that seems to have been opened and then upon further inspection the product almost did not come out as if it were half empty sadly very dissatisfied.'
'B0CKHBR8JM','N/A','N/A','I play a lot of golf in GA and I need protection from the sun. In addition to a wide brim hat I apply this sun cream on my face before I play or if I‚Äôm going be out in the sun for an extended period. It‚Äôs not cheap but neither is MOHS surgery.'
'B0CKHBR8JM','N/A','N/A',"Been using thi.s brand for years. Usaually buy it with my FSA on AMAZON. It's kinda pricey. But, what's the trade off for skin cancer. I'm fair skinned, so I do not take chances. Do your research and decide for yourself."
'B0CKHBR8JM','N/A','N/A','No funciona el envase'
'B0CKHBR8JM','N/A','N/A','I just wanna say wow I love this sunscreen I will keep purchasing does not leave you skin white'
'B0CKHBR8JM','N/A','N/A','Second time I have ordered this and the air pump has been broken.'
'B0CKHBR8JM','N/A','N/A','So I have heard a lot about Elta MD sunscreen from dermatologists and media. But I was a little disappointed that it came leaking straight from the package. Though I also understand I wasn‚Äôt able to get to it right away from my doorstep but for it to leak and cost $41. Seems pretty steep for a product package to do that even factoring in the more liquidy formula. Has a slight powder smell but not strong absorbs fast into skin- and hopefully will continue to not break me out.'
'B0CKHBR8JM','N/A','N/A',"I've tried so many different ways to apply this, but it always ends up pilling while I'm rubbing it in. It's even happened after I arrived at work. I can't justify the price to eventually end up with gel boogies on my face if I touch it. I think it might be a good sunscreen for some, but it isn't working for me."
'B0CKHBR8JM','N/A','N/A',"I used this for a few months over the summer and then had to shove it out of sight because I couldnt stand the thought of how much money I'd used on something I can't use. I heard so many good things about this product, but the thing pills like CRAZY on my face. I tried 4 different moisturizers (all light ones, I dont use heavy/rich moisturizers), I've tried waiting 15-30 mins after applying moisturizer, I tried wiping my face with toner first, I tried NO moisturizer, I tried everything I could think of. Still pills---which means it's not blocking sun much if at all. And yes, expected, my acne scars darkened over the summer. At this point, I wondered if I had simply been given a faulty product where the formula was falling apart, because no one else seemed to have this issue? Absolutely baffling. Really wanted to like it, esp when it's so pricy."
'B0CKHBR8JM','N/A','N/A','Me gusta no deja grasoso ni blanco en la cara'
'B0CKHBR8JM','N/A','N/A',"'This sunscreen was recommended to my husband by his dermatologist. His review is ""I am so grateful to have been turned on to it. I have really sensitive skin and I break out easily but this sunscreen goes on a clean and doesn\'t clog my pores and it doesn\'t feel greasy at all which is something that really annoys me about sunscreen in general. Highly recommend.""'"
'B0CKHBR8JM','N/A','N/A','ME ENCTANTO DEJA LA PIEL SUPER HIDRATADA Y CON BUENA FACTOR SOLAR'
'B0CKHBR8JM','N/A','N/A',"Love this product and use it all the time. Unfortunately, this shipment's pump does not work and doesn't pump out the product. Just finished the last shipment and opened the new one today and could not get the Sunscreen to come out. :-("
'B0CKHBR8JM','N/A','N/A','The media could not be loaded. I got this product yesterday and the bottle is empty! Come on! It‚Äôs like $40 and this is what I am going to get?'
'B0CKHBR8JM','N/A','N/A','I have been using this sunscreen since 2020 and nothing compares. I went through a 3 month period where I switched to another brand and it was much to greasy for my skin. The white cast fades quickly after applying and I tend to wait 10min before apply any make up.'
'B0CKHBR8JM','N/A','N/A','Cuando lo intente usar no sal√≠a nada de producto me fue totalmente inservible'
'B0CKHBR8JM','N/A','N/A',This sunscreen is the absolute best. I have sensitive and dry skin and I've tried so many different brands. This one is by far the most gentle and it's invisible on the skin!
'B0CKHBR8JM','N/A','N/A','I ordered this product to have as a backup Sunscreen I‚Äôve been using it for a while. Just tried to use it unfortunately the valve that pumps out the product is defective and not pumping up the sunscreen. So it‚Äôs garbage I have no sunscreen and the window for return is closed. Bummer.'
'B0CKHBR8JM','N/A','N/A','Elta makes great products'
'B0CKHBR8JM','N/A','N/A','I hardly ever write reviews but THIS !!! Omg I loveeeeee it made my skin so clear üòç I can‚Äôt live without it. I started seeing results after a month and got ask if I got a facial.'
'B0CKHBR8JM','N/A','N/A',"Absolutely love this product, always continue to purchase it. I have recommended it to friends and family as well and they also love it! It's lightweight and effective. I live in a desert so this is perfect lol"
'B0CKHBR8JM','N/A','N/A','I have been using this product for four years. It is lightweight yet provides full sun protection. It‚Äôs important to apply this product over your other skin products. .'
'B0CKHBR8JM','N/A','N/A','Pump does not work therefore completely unable to use this product.'
'B0CKHBR8JM','N/A','N/A','This sunscreen is amazing. Smooth light weight provides great spf coverage and is not visible at all. My skins loves it.'
'B0CKHBR8JM','N/A','N/A','This product is a complete scam. $40 for a sample size bottle is nuts even in this economy. Returned it for a refund. You can get better sunscreen for less.'
'B0CKHBR8JM','N/A','N/A','One of the best.'
'B0CKHBR8JM','N/A','N/A',"'I\'ll start off by saying that this is the best sunscreen I have found that does NOT do any of the following: 1. Make my skin greasy. I hate that. 2. Make my skin breakout. 3. Leave a white-cast. No sunscreen is truly perfect of course but this one is pretty darn close especially if you have sensitive or acne prone skin! I have had acne since I was 12. I\'m 22 now. You name the medication or topical I\'ve been on it (including ACUTANE!! Nothing can stop this face from breaking out lol!). This is the only sunscreen I\'ve tried that does not add onto my problems! I encourage anyone who tries this and has skin like mine to give it a few tries before you write it off-- some products tend to make my skin go ""what\'s happening??"" for about a week just because I\'m breaking its normal routine. But seriously give this a try!'"
'B0CKHBR8JM','N/A','N/A','This product was purchased for my daughter who thinks it is great! She uses it daily with or without foundation.'
'B0CKHBR8JM','N/A','N/A',"I use this on my son, who has sensitive skin. Other sunblocks that are for sensitive skin leave a very obvious white tint. This doesn't do that"
'B0CKHBR8JM','N/A','N/A','I‚Äôve been using this product for many years goes on clear not heavy can easily use with make up. Love this one and highly recommend for every skin type'
