'B0CKJ1T58V','Really good but expensive and low SPF','5.0 out of 5 stars','Sunscreen and moisturizer combined. So great for a minimal skincare routine or for travel. Doesn’t burn eyes. It is a little thick to apply. But you could mix this with your serum to make it more easily spreadable. Not a deal breaker for me.  I have oily skin and this ends up looking quite oily on me. So I do need to apply powder to tone things down.  The tint worked for my fair-ish skin but I think it may end up leaving a cast on darker skin tones. However it does tend to settle nicely into skin as time passes.  The tint looks much better when it’s been on for a couple of hours. I wore this at around 4pm and my skin looked better at 7pm than it did at 4.  I love this for a no makeup look when I’m going out to run errands or something but this simply cannot replace my other sunscreen.  There are two cons in my book. One is that the SPF is too low for India. However I knew this going in so I wear a higher SPF sunscreen below this one. My goal in buying this was to see what the tint was like.  And two this is so bloody expensive in India. In the US this is a super affordable drugstore brand but we end up paying for this through the nose as if it’s a luxury brand. I think for this reason alone I’d avoid buying this particular product again. Unless Cerave officially arrives in India and the prices get more reasonable.'
'B0CKJ1T58V','Best','5.0 out of 5 stars','It best sunscreen … no .1 in my opinion'
'B0CKJ1T58V','Acne','1.0 out of 5 stars','Why they have added salicylic. May be thats irritating my skin n causing acne. They must make it gentle.'
'B0CKJ1T58V','Worse','1.0 out of 5 stars','Looks like a clown with white cast. Not good for Indian skin. Very difficult to remove using face wash. need to use make up remover..'
'B0CKJ1T58V','Very good','5.0 out of 5 stars','Very good color and good sun protection'
'B0CKJ1T58V','Do not buy if you have dark skin','1.0 out of 5 stars','This made me look like a clown. The tint disappeared as soon as it touched my face and I ended up having an aggressive white cast.'
'B0CKJ1T58V','N/A','N/A','I love this product so much and it is my 3 rd time ordering it. It does not leve a white mark on your face and I don’t need to use a foundation. Serves the purpose of sunscreen and foundation in one application. Love this'
'B0CKJ1T58V','N/A','N/A',"Since it's zinc-based, I was concerned that it might not blend or absorb easily, but I was mistaken. It's very easy to apply - the neutral shade is a tiny bit on the yellow side and I am a cool tone, so that's my only minor complaint. Provides some coverage while not feeling makeup-y, and sun protection seems to be good as well. Also easy to layer for extra coverage and protection."
'B0CKJ1T58V','N/A','N/A','I use this instead of foundation - tinted is a great option'
'B0CKJ1T58V','N/A','N/A','The CeraVa tinted facial cream is perfect for my fair slightly dry face. The coverage is light and goes on silky smooth. It blends in well no unsightly lines and has sufficient sunscreen for extra protection.'
'B0CKJ1T58V','N/A','N/A','Great product Provides smooth and even sunscreen coverage'
'B0CKJ1T58V','N/A','N/A',"It's a little dry and difficult to spread. Definitely has sunscreen smell and feel. Works well. I'm not sure I'll use the whole bottle or will purchase again. It does what it claims to do, I just prefer some of the tinted moisturizers I've also discovered recently."
'B0CKJ1T58V','N/A','N/A','This product is great for travel because it moisturizes and gives a hint of coverage and color. No need for two or three different items. This product a lip/cheek blush & mascara are all I need to feel put together while traveling anywhere.'
'B0CKJ1T58V','N/A','N/A',This is the only suncreen/foundation I've found & used that doesn't cause me to breakout like crazy. I will continue using this product for as long as they make it!
'B0CKJ1T58V','N/A','N/A','I’ve been using this product for a year now and it’s the best thing out there. This has replaced my foundation and moisturizer because it works so well and looks great. apply a light serum underneath and for some color I use Jones Road miracle balm on my cheeks and lips and set to go. Thanks for helping this low maintenance gal look fab.'
'B0CKJ1T58V','N/A','N/A','Oh this is tied with La Roche-Posay for face tinted sunscreen. I always wear sunscreen on my face per my dermatologist every day and when I like about this it’s tinted so it looks like face make up so blends right into my face. It’s creamy and I love it.'
'B0CKJ1T58V','N/A','N/A','Right off the bat this was too orange for my fair skin tone…this only got progressively worse as the day went on. Don’t get me wrong I LOVE CeraVe! However this particular product just wasn’t for me.'
'B0CKJ1T58V','N/A','N/A','I love Josie Maran Protect + Perfect 47 SPF but my wallet doesn’t. I wish the Cerave was a higher SPF but I wise this as my daily for going to the office and use the JM if I’m going to be outside longer. This is also more matte than the JM which nice. The Cerave goes over my hyaluronic acid and other serums smoothly. This functions as a sheer foundation for me and I add a bit of concealer where I need it and use a cream stick blushes so it all blends together nicely. Pigment-wise this comes out as more of an orange tint whereas Josie Maran is a bit more towards red and Neutrogena is a little more pinkish. So for me this works out well since I have yellow undertones. I already use niacinamide in my daily skincare routine so this didn’t cause any purging issues and the ceramides are a nice bonus because I occasionally get psoriasis flare ups in parts of my face.'
'B0CKJ1T58V','N/A','N/A','This sunscreen provides just a little tint of color but a lot of protection. I trust this brand and was happy that they made a tinted sunscreen in addition to all of their other skincare Not too sticky or greasy feeling. Feels light on skin once it is all blended it'
'B0CKJ1T58V','N/A','N/A','Works well leaves my skin looking dewey.'
'B0CKJ1T58V','N/A','N/A','Immediately after applying skin looks healthy glowy though quite heavy weight. Not suitable for layering ( serums etc)  it peels. After few days of using this SPF I woke up to clogged pores and acne which was unexpected because of the ingredients (niacinamide).'
'B0CKJ1T58V','N/A','N/A',Leaves a white cast in my skin unless I smooth it in a lot. I barely use it because of the cast it leaves. But it works OK. I don't know if I'd buy this again.
'B0CKJ1T58V','N/A','N/A','It states it is hydrating but it was extremely drying on my skin. It settled into every crevice and wrinkle on my face. I am not young by any means but with this I looked like an ancient clay sculpture.'
'B0CKJ1T58V','N/A','N/A','Use this for my face except when applying foundation…great protection for golfing gardening enjoying sun and water. No need to keep rubbing it in… disappears with no white cast (Caucasian)…. I have sensitive skin and it doesn’t irritate it. And the price is reasonable… I am a repeat buyer…have used for a couple of years.'
'B0CKJ1T58V','N/A','N/A','FINALLY a tinted version of my favorite facial sunscreen!! CeraVe is my go-to lotion for face and body!'
'B0CKJ1T58V','N/A','N/A','I love this product. I wear it instead of makeup and it works great! I will continue to buy it often.'
'B0CKJ1T58V','N/A','N/A',"This sunscreen's shinny effect works great for my dry skin! I had tried other facial foundations of different brands; they dried on my skin after a few hours and deepened my fine lines. But this sunscreen is quite moisturizing. Although some 1-star reviews complained that it's too shinny and thick, I actually like the trendy shinny look! Just don't over-apply."
'B0CKJ1T58V','N/A','N/A','No protege nada simplemente es un maquillaje'
'B0CKJ1T58V','N/A','N/A',"It's like putting resin on your skin. It doesn't absorb. An hour after applying, i swiped my cheek and it got brown foundation color all over my shirt."
'B0CKJ1T58V','N/A','N/A','I decided to try this after a bottle of more expensive tinted moisturizer (DRMTLGY) ran out. I was happy with that product and this one seemed to have similar ingredients and way less of a price. I’m sticking to this Cerave brand for sure! It has even more tint/coverage and makes my skin look great. I never forget to wear it bc it has become my base foundation. If I feel like doing a lot of makeup I might add a little foundation powder on top but no more liquid foundation. When first put on it is a bit greasy but “Dewy” is in. Plus it absorbed quickly and I feel moisturized all day. This is definitely going to be a staple for me now.'
'B0CKJ1T58V','N/A','N/A','I love this product. I have complicated skin. Sometimes I’m oily and sometimes I’m dry. My skin tone is slightly warm/olive. My skin doesn’t handle makeup/foundation well. This product was highly recommended by my esthetician for daily use. Because it does have a slight tint I’m able to use it as “foundation”. It doesn’t feel heavy. It’s very easy to reapply. No weird smell and no breakouts. I’ve been using this for about 2 years now and won’t go a day without it!'
'B0CKJ1T58V','N/A','N/A','my face looks good . i love it.'
'B0CKJ1T58V','N/A','N/A','I love the elta MD tinted sunscreen and was looking for a similar more budget friendly product. This has worked great thus far. I have light olive skin and this blends very well. I wear some powder foundation over looks great!'
'B0CKJ1T58V','N/A','N/A','I like the quality. A little bit goes a long way. It’s zinc oxide mineral sunscreen which is a favorite of mine and difficult to find in face sunscreens.  My only issue is the shine. Makes my face so shiny and I don’t wear powder or make up so I’d prefer a more matte look.  But I think matte screens can be drying so I will probably be repurchasing. :)'
'B0CKJ1T58V','N/A','N/A','Es perfecto soy piel grasa y no me deja mucho brillo durante el día parte que es humectante'
'B0CKJ1T58V','N/A','N/A','Its lightweight texture and my very moisturizing the color was a little dark for me but it wasn’t a problem'
'B0CKJ1T58V','N/A','N/A','Nice light coverage sun screen.'
'B0CKJ1T58V','N/A','N/A','Por el precio pence Que sería un poco más mejor la verdad es k parece un protector común de un costo más varato ya que este uno lo compra porque pensamos que trae color y tapará las imperfecciones pero no cubre nada es como todos así que si van a comprar por qué trae color no malgasten su dinero o inviertan en algo más costoso que en verdad funciona aparte se siente muy pesado 👎'
'B0CKJ1T58V','N/A','N/A',"I really like this sunscreen because it doesn't clog my pores or make me break out, and the tint also covers redness/discoloration. I'm quite pale (largely because I try to avoid sun exposure on my face) so the shade of this sunscreen doesn't blend perfectly with my skin, but the easy solution I've found is to mix this with the Cerave non-tinted moisturizing sunscreen (2 parts non-tinted to 1 part tinted). I mix the two on the back of my hand before applying with my fingertips. This sunscreen does make me look a little bit shinier than I would like, so once it dries I go in with a bit of setting powder to bring the shine down to a manageable level. Anyway, I like this product a lot and would definitely recommend it, especially if you're a little more tan than I am."
'B0CKJ1T58V','N/A','N/A',Not a very seamless application you will have a emote cast on your skin if you're more melanatef and using.
'B0CKJ1T58V','N/A','N/A','Excelente producto'
'B0CKJ1T58V','N/A','N/A','I am in love with this sunscreen leaves your skin beautiful I used it every day and I am getting a lot of compliments  about how it looks my skin I really like it I got the subscription every 4 months and anyway here in Amazon with the subscription is less expensive. I am in love with this product.'
'B0CKJ1T58V','N/A','N/A','Love the color. Blends with my complexion. I put on right after my moisturizer since it is a tad dry to put on'
'B0CKJ1T58V','N/A','N/A',I use the regular body and face moisturizer and love them. I tried this product for the 1st time and absolutely love it also. A little goes a very long way so literally start with a pea size and go from there. The consistency is on the thinner/silkier side so don't waste it by using too much
'B0CKJ1T58V','N/A','N/A','The media could not be loaded. I really like this facial sunscreen. Since it’s mineral it doesn’t sting or irritate your eyes. The color blends well and doesn’t have an orange undertone. As soon as you put it in it’s very shiny but after a while it dries. It’s not matte though but not shiny.  For some reason some product exploded in the cap getting the exterior a little dirty too. But nothing terrible.  Overall great product!'
'B0CKJ1T58V','N/A','N/A','Love the fact that it is easy and go on smooth. Adds just a hint of color and protects.'
'B0CKJ1T58V','N/A','N/A','Prefect covage and sun protection'
'B0CKJ1T58V','N/A','N/A','I have a very sensitive combination skin type and it hates most powders and foundations so I have been in love with tinted moisturizers and sunscreens. I love everything about this tinted sunscreen because:  1) Moisturizing 2) Sun protection 3) Goes on smooth 4) Blends well with my naturally medium skin tone 5) Does not cause me breakouts  I will not be using this for one sole reason: 1) Leaves my face VERY shiny. I have to avoid powders on top of my skin and the only way for it to reduce shine for me is to use mineral finishing powder.  I would recommend this for people who already use powder finishes. The shiny look it leaves is not glowy or pretty. It looks oily/greasy.'
'B0CKJ1T58V','N/A','N/A','This lotion gives you an even skin tone with a nice glow to it. It fills in your pores and protects you from the sun! I use it every day.'
'B0CKJ1T58V','N/A','N/A',I love this tinted moisturizer. Goes on smooth and covers. I haven't used foundation since I purchased this product!!
