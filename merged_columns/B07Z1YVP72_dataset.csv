'B07Z1YVP72','Protects the laptops from most of the things.','4.0 out of 5 stars',"'It perfectly fits my Dell Laptop maybe you can fit a thiccer gaming laptop. I haven\'t tested its ""waterproof"" claims because I don\'t wanna risk losing my laptop. (Allegedly) It might help during the rain and also my backpack has less padding and a loose compartment for the laptop so this protects it from continuosly bumping onto my back or the notebooks. 8.8/10 because the padding on the inside was less on certain areas. You might get cheaper ones with case for chargers but I can\'t comment on those ones as I haven\'t used them.'"
