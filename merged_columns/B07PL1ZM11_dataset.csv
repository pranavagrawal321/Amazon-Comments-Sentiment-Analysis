'B07PL1ZM11','Would not recommended green one','1.0 out of 5 stars','Blue is alright but the green one is so light in colour and has an extremely watery consistency...it barely holds on the brush or shows up on skin.

'B07PL1ZM11','The colour payoff on me wasnt that great!','3.0 out of 5 stars',"Okay first of I had a lot of expectations from this one as I had tried the blue variant from the same product, and I love that one so much! This on the other hand was a bit disappointing because the colour was very different from what I had expected.. also it didn't show up that well on my eyelids! So this is just a small warning to anyone who wants to get it after trying the blue one, the green isnt that good! otherwise there is no other issues with it.  Pros: -Affordable -Easy to use/Beginner friendly  Cons: -Colour payoff is not that great"
