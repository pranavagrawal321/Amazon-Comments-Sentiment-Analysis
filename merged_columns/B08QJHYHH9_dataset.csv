'B08QJHYHH9','Good for new Users but not for Professional works.','3.0 out of 5 stars',"Using it for some time and after some usage, the edges are showing their color. For this price range, the Mouse Pad is good, has a slick design and the mouse glides smoothly but the fabric is giving up. It's not durable but it depends on the user's usage."
'B08QJHYHH9','Not up to the mark','1.0 out of 5 stars',"Finishing is poor, cloth coming out from sides. Print doesn't look good as shown in picture."
'B08QJHYHH9','Perfect for casual use and small setups','5.0 out of 5 stars','This is a budget mouse pad and is meant for casual use or maybe on a work setup. This is not a gaming level mouse pad. You need to buy a better and more dedicated one if you are a serious gamer. It is small in size and is not appropriate for FPS games. It can be used for casual gaming though.  I would recommend this generally to those people who want to use this in a compact setup. I am also using this in my secondary setup where the space is a constraint.  This is neither a speed-type and nor a control-type pad. It is a normal mouse pad with a somewhat balanced resistance to mouse movement. You can go for it as per your use case as there is no issue in the quality.'
