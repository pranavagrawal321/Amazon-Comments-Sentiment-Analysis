'B08MFG2DZM','The top sheet is plastic','2.0 out of 5 stars','I was in the market for a new brand of pads because I got bored of whisper. I bought evereve and was saddened to see the top sheet is plastic (the kind that whisper choice has and is sure to give you rashes). Since I opened the pack I can‚Äôt even return it. The glue doesn‚Äôt stick properly so it gets folded in ways that‚Äôll make you very nervous about stepping out or sitting down. The wings aren‚Äôt broad and combined with the poor glue you know it‚Äôs a recipe for disaster. So yeah this was a big waste of money.'

'B08MFG2DZM','Not cottony soft cover !','3.0 out of 5 stars','No doubt that the pads are super thin but the cover is dry plasticy sheet and is not cottony soft. So the women who have rashe problems will not be comfortable with this napkin. I am disappointed.'

'B08MFG2DZM','Good Sanitary Pads','4.0 out of 5 stars',I have been using this product for about a month now and e feel I have used it enough to give a fair review. The pads are a great deal for the price you pay to begin with. The packet has 30 pads for under ‚Çπ150 ( ‚Çπ139 to be precise). The size that I bought is medium 280mm or 28cm (true to its claim). They are thin and you wouldn't even feel like you have them on. They are well absorbant and doesn't irritate the skin. The cotton doesn't gather in between. The onky thing that I thought could have been done was that it could have had double wings; as in it could have stickable wings at the back as well so it would remain intact. Over-all I could say that I would highly recommend this one so ling as they don't greedily hike their price.
