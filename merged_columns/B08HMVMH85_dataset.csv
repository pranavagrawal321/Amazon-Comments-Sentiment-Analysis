'B08HMVMH85','Overpriced','1.0 out of 5 stars','Using Cartini since forever. Quality has seriously gone done scissors giving an uncomfortable feeling not buttery smooth. Finish not good. Colour is horrible. Black should not be allowed in house had to buy as mine one cannot be found. What a waste. Update : this product is of so low quality that this can be a fake. Local 40 scissors are much better look make and quality than this one. Now tgis has become a liability. Not buying this brand again.'
