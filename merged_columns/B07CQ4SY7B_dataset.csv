'B07CQ4SY7B','Not for heavy flows','3.0 out of 5 stars','Pros: -Thin -Each pad comes with an individual cover  Cons: -Not very long -Top plastic cover might give rashes if worn for too long i.e. It’s not soft and cottony  Don’t wear it for heavy flow days. It’s good for the last couple of light flow days'

'B07CQ4SY7B','Total waste!!! Top layer comes out after wearing it for an hour','1.0 out of 5 stars',"After 2-3 hours of wearing, the top layer of the pad is coming out and all the inner sheet are falling while going to Loo. I always used 'stayfree all night ultra dry max' which are very good. So I bought this one, but I'm disappointed with the adhesion quality.  Absorption is also not good.  I don't recommend to buy this particular item."
