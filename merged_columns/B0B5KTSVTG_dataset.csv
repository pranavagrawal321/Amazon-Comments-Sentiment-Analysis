'B0B5KTSVTG','Low Sound, Exhaust on the side of screen, Bad GPU''3.0 out of 5 stars''You have to set your GPU to being used and when you set that Windows warn you that it will start giving undesired behavior. Sound is very low you definitely require external speakers. Even if you do normal browsing the keyboard heats up.'
'B0B5KTSVTG','Worth the cost','4.0 out of 5 stars','I bought this laptop in August 2023. I am very happy with the purchase. I am an Embedded SW Developer and I do need to run IDEs and other software which utilize good amount of processor and RAM. This laptop comes with a very powerful processor and it is sufficient for my usage. I have also ran software like Adobe PhotoShop etc. and the CPU/GPU handles it perfectly. This laptop is thin and light even though it comes with a graphics card which is cherry on the cake. I am not a heavy gamer I do play Valorant and PUBG occasionally and the performance of the laptop is pretty good.  There are some CONS: 1. Not so good battery backup. It hardly lasts for 2-3 hours. 2. The camera cover is not available. 3. Sound quality is not-so-good.  I knew these cons of the laptop before purchasing and I was ready to compromise. Overall this is a great laptop as it suits my needs and budget. You can buy it if you are into Graphics development/SW Development and a lite gamer. This laptop is worth the money.'

'B0B5KTSVTG','Hot Designâ€¦ Pathetically Hot Design','2.0 out of 5 stars','The Hot air exit designed to blow air on to its own monitorâ€¦ may be they want us to watch hot movies with hot air..  The Laptop can be used as hot pack for people who have muscle pains. After few hours it have automatic die for ever mode. You donâ€™t even need to shut it down.

This has a standard look. Overall happy with Acer aspire 5.'
'B0B5KTSVTG','Performance is good but less battery backup','4.0 out of 5 stars',"The performance of the laptop is good in 16gb version. But it legs in battery performance. After using two months, the batter backup is just 2 hours maximum on continuous usage. It is good for programming & coding, day to day usage, I can't say about the gamming performance as I don't play. If you want to use for graphics designing then you should prefer more powerful cpu than this one. After using 2 months I can say, upto heavy coding & programming it is good beyond it you should prefer other"

The Wi-Fi is a hit-or-miss, causing major connectivity issues. And don't even get me started on the customer service â€“ utterly incompetent and no resolution provided. Amazon's service is a letdown, and this laptop is a nightmare. The software isn't updated, so you'll have to endure the headache of reaching out to Acer and spending hours updating it. What could be more frustrating? Amazon's role in this whole ordeal is just pathetic, offering zero help. Save yourself the trouble and avoid this laptop at all costs!"
