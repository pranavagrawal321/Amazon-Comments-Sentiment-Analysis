'B07NDMWV15','Unfunctional Extender','2.0 out of 5 stars',"'Got my toolkit today and upon trying out the extender which was my main reason for ordering this bigger set from JK it proved itself to be totally useless. When having mounted the required bit on the extender I tried to unscrew a 1"" screw from a plastic box the extender was spinning freely independent of the screwdriver head. These kinds of screws are the ones that require the least amount of effort to turn the screw driver but here it was this obsolete piece of s**t free-styling by itself while the head piece was stuck to the screw without moving even a tiny bit.  The rest of the bits are somewhat of an average quality in their feel and performance. It would have been better if I had ordered the smaller 5 piece set. These companies simply want to make money by getting in on a feature that all the other companies are making and never bother to properly test out their products to check if they are making something that is usable.  I would advise the buyer to just go for the 5-piece tool kit to save themselves some time and money and stay away from the sets that have extenders in them.'"

'B07NDMWV15','Good product at the budget but need to be more robust','4.0 out of 5 stars',"Though the product is good it is not strong as spartan Or taparia screwdriver, the lock mechanism is similar, smoother but lighter it seems to be made of spring steel, tooling is of good quality ,the shanks bits are made of steel (spring steel) and slightly magnetic the locking mechanism is good and smooth but what liked about it , is it quite light compared to it's competitor's and very budget friendly. Though I have a suggestion to the company to make a specs like box it's much easy to carry."
