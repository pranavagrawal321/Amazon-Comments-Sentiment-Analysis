'B00LZPT1A4','A Decent Fountain Pen with a Few Flaws','4.0 out of 5 stars',"Dear fellow Amazon shoppers, my name is Tejaswa Dogney, and I wanted to share my thoughts on the Parker Vector Mettalix Fountain Pen (Blue) with Free Blue Quink Ink Bottle. If you find my review helpful, please consider marking it as such to assist other potential buyers.  Let me start by outlining the pros and cons of this fountain pen:  Pros:  The pen has a slightly premium look, giving it a touch of elegance. The package includes a free blue Quink ink bottle, which is a nice bonus. Despite its flaws, this pen remains one of the better options in the market due to the limited availability of alternatives in this price range. Cons:  The grip of this pen is not the best; it tends to slip quite often, which can be frustrating during extended writing sessions. The metal body adds weight to the pen, making it a bit heavier than I would prefer. Now, let's delve into the details. The Parker Vector Mettalix Fountain Pen offers a modestly sophisticated design, making it suitable for both professional and personal use. However, I did find some issues with its performance. The grip, unfortunately, falls short in providing a secure hold, often resulting in slippage. This aspect can be quite bothersome, especially if you frequently use fountain pens for writing or sketching.  Moreover, the pen's metal body contributes to its weightiness, which might not appeal to everyone. If you prefer a lighter writing instrument, this pen might not be the ideal choice for you.  Despite these drawbacks, I have chosen to give this pen a rating of 4 out of 5 stars. Why, you may ask? Well, the truth is that in today's digital age, fountain pens have become somewhat of a rarity. Consequently, the availability of options within this price range is limited. Given the lack of alternatives, the Parker Vector Mettalix Fountain Pen emerges as one of the better choices, despite its imperfections and relatively higher price point.  In conclusion, if you're in search of a fountain pen that exudes a touch of class and don't mind dealing with a slightly slippery grip and a heavier feel, the Parker Vector Mettalix Fountain Pen could be a suitable option for you. However, if you prioritize a secure grip and a lightweight design, you may want to explore other alternatives."
'B00LZPT1A4','Bad flow and breaks while writing','1.0 out of 5 stars',"I gifted this pen to my daughter as she prefers using fountain pen over ball pen. But unfortunately this pen didn't solved the purpose at all. Do not offer a good flow of writing and breaks frequently. Need to open the entire pen, push the needle to get the ink to nib so that it can start writing. It waiste lot of time so do not recommend at all."
