'B0C1447PZ6','For school kids','2.0 out of 5 stars',"Pros - Light weight - Sturdy - Display and sound are good  Cons - Average performance - Doesn't have backlit keyboard - No finger print sensor to sign-in - Doesn't support face sign-in (says camera is not compatible) - No thunderbolt cable to support dock station  Verdict Go for it if you are buying a laptop for your kid to study, but there are lots of cheaper options available for that."
'B0C1447PZ6','Not a bad product for professionals or college students','4.0 out of 5 stars',"Earlier I had HP i5 5th gen Laptop and the rest of the features were more or less same but the best fact about this laptop is: way more faster than the previous laptops which I've used.  Pros: Faster, Looks, Lighter in weight, Cool mouse touchpad, Awesome Camera, Finger print enabled power button, dashing keyboard looks, less sized games run quick, no problem in multi tab works, superb sound quality.  Cons: Heating issue while playing heavy games, too much sound when used for a long time & battery backup is not as expected (after full charge, the laptop can work max for 3 to 4hrs).  Overall this are the characteristics of the laptop that I faced after I received it, yesterday."

'B0C1447PZ6','Ok....ishh product','3.0 out of 5 stars',"I would not say it's a great product, I have been using this for a few days only. Speed and performance is Excellent so far, but heats up alot and has only 2 hr of life so far , old technology laptop works longer than that  The build quality is bad like really bad, looks plastic feels plastic, and bends like plastic on pressing also this is a fingerprint magnet.  I would recommend going for Lenovo or hp laptop as that has the same specs so theoretically that would work the same and has better looks , but you have trust on the hardware go for this ."
