'B08C9B7PTZ','N/A','N/A','Es bueno pero no era lo que deeeaba.'
'B08C9B7PTZ','N/A','N/A','Works really well on our LVP floors.'
'B08C9B7PTZ','N/A','N/A',"There's is a 12 month warranty - how do I activate this? This is my second mop (bought my first a couple of years ago and it's been perfect, bought the second for upstairs) and it was great until a piece of the handle attachment right by the bottle chipped and so the handle no longer will stay connected.  Sorry to give a low star rating my first mop has been, and still is, great. Hope to hear from you at which time I'll up date the review."
'B08C9B7PTZ','N/A','N/A',The product is awesome since you can use different cleaners. You're not stuck with the same scent all the time. It works great
'B08C9B7PTZ','N/A','N/A','Love it! it is easy to use. I love it!'
'B08C9B7PTZ','N/A','N/A','Poor quality'
'B08C9B7PTZ','N/A','N/A','Use it couple times the Handel broke everytime you spray the Handel comes out it is frustrating never buy again this is the second one I thrashed'
'B08C9B7PTZ','N/A','N/A',"Easy to put together (even for seniors....), easy to handle, light and doesn't take up much space."
'B08C9B7PTZ','N/A','N/A','Able to mix my own cleaning solutions.'
'B08C9B7PTZ','N/A','N/A','Cleans great like it doesn’t need batteries. Must have for cleaning'
'B08C9B7PTZ','N/A','N/A','Would not recommend. The mop trigger and handle broke after less than a month of use. Better options out there.'
'B08C9B7PTZ','N/A','N/A','I feel like this is not made very well . It feels flimsy and I feel like it’s not going to last long at all. The sprayer on handle feels like it’s going to break. I have only used it twice and I am afraid to use it again due to it breaking. Maybe the company will contact me and make this right.'
'B08C9B7PTZ','N/A','N/A',"I liked the mop while it lasted. Easy to use, lightweight, easy to clean the mop head. I believe it should have lasted more than 18 months. I don't use it every day or for very long. The plastic part in the handle that operates the trigger to release the liquid broke. Cannot repair."
'B08C9B7PTZ','N/A','N/A','Worked well but only for a month'
'B08C9B7PTZ','N/A','N/A','So far product is great makes cleaning easy !'
'B08C9B7PTZ','N/A','N/A','ok'
'B08C9B7PTZ','N/A','N/A',"When it was fresh out of the box, the nozzle for spray worked very well. After a few months use, spray nozzle for fluid stopped working! I made sure the nozzle was clear from blockage. When I press the handle, there's not resistance and no spray. I had this exact model from same vendor which I used for several years! This is my second mop, it wasn't as good as first one."
'B08C9B7PTZ','N/A','N/A','I purchased this and really liked how light and easy it was to use. The mop pads are great and stick will. However after just a few months the spray nozzle stopped working. Now it’s just a glorified mop.'
'B08C9B7PTZ','N/A','N/A','I put some solution in this cleaned my floors and then set it aside. Came back to find all the solution (which is an expensive solution we buy for our hardwood floors) had ALL leaked out onto the floor. Unbelievable. This thing is crap.'
'B08C9B7PTZ','N/A','N/A','Exactly what I wanted Nice pads not too long like others I’ve tried. Handy for quick swipe of water my dog is a slob walks away water everywhere.'
'B08C9B7PTZ','N/A','N/A','Had just a little over a month by 3 days and the trigger that you spray with got stuck and will no longer work.'
'B08C9B7PTZ','N/A','N/A','This mop worked great at first but proceeded to fall apart part after part within the first year of use. Now it’s in pieces at the dump. Do not recommend.'
'B08C9B7PTZ','N/A','N/A','Like the convenience of mopping but it leaks even after you spray. So I’ll be returning it maybe I had a faulty mop. Except for that I like it'
'B08C9B7PTZ','N/A','N/A','I love this mop much easier then a swifter I have both and I love this mop way more. Makes it easy to use to those quick messes'
'B08C9B7PTZ','N/A','N/A','The container does not seal properly and leaks continuously through the vavle and the seal. I actually have to use a different mop to wipe up all the excess liquid left by this mop. Totally useless and the there is no way to contact the seller so no option for a warranty.'
'B08C9B7PTZ','N/A','N/A','Cleans nice and is a money saver.'
'B08C9B7PTZ','N/A','N/A','I absolutely love this mop so much that I purchased two more for gifts.'
'B08C9B7PTZ','N/A','N/A','Simple design and ease of operation'
'B08C9B7PTZ','N/A','N/A','Doesn’t feel like a chore glides easily'
'B08C9B7PTZ','N/A','N/A','Cannot be used or fixed'
'B08C9B7PTZ','N/A','N/A',I love bona and this makes it easier to use. The padsar absorbent and wash great. I can't believe how this brought out the detail in my floor. I didn't give it a 5 for deep cleaning because I don't have cracks that indent so I don't know.
'B08C9B7PTZ','N/A','N/A','Have been looking for something like this. No more buying special liquid cleaner and disposable cloths. I absolutely love it. You can put whatever cleaner in it and just throw the mop cloths in the washer.'
'B08C9B7PTZ','N/A','N/A','The spray bottle is hard to extract. Spray stopped after few uses. Very disappointed'
'B08C9B7PTZ','N/A','N/A','It worked well the first few months and I loved how you could hang it for easy storage but here we are 8 months out and it comes apart. I reattach it hoping I would still be able to clean my floors; however it would not spray the cleaning solution. I took the solution bottle out to see if I perhaps placed it in the slot incorrectly and noticed some broken plastic pieces. So I do not recommend this product it broke in less than a year.'
'B08C9B7PTZ','N/A','N/A','Cleans so good love the pads and the large water bottle so you can clean longer without having to refill bottle. Mop feels very sturdy'
'B08C9B7PTZ','N/A','N/A','Easy to use and clean.'
'B08C9B7PTZ','N/A','N/A','This multi purpose cleaning tool is great it made my floors so clean easy to out together and great on hard wood floors I did add my floor cleaner it shoots out and spreads out over the floor making it easy to do cover a lot of flooring.'
'B08C9B7PTZ','N/A','N/A','I wouldn’t use this for deep cleaning but for quick clean ups it’s great to have'
'B08C9B7PTZ','N/A','N/A','Not my like . Broke in 2 months (4times) of usage . Spray handle stopped to work then the bottle to liquid got struck and jammed the entire spray nozzle.'
'B08C9B7PTZ','N/A','N/A','Love you can wash'
'B08C9B7PTZ','N/A','N/A','I ordered this mop as it had good reviews. Upon arrival this mop was all i had hoped for till the squirt mechanism broke after a month. I ordered another thinking it was perhaps a fluke or bad one. Second one arrived and same problem. The trigger mechanism is very cheap and not durable. I would NOT recmend this to anyone'
'B08C9B7PTZ','N/A','N/A','It was really handy and easy to use except after two weeks of use the tank started to leak so I had to throw it away cause u would get more on the floor without even spraying it'
'B08C9B7PTZ','N/A','N/A','Squirt handle stopped working before the two month mark. Cheap plastic material did not hold up well. Also leaks mop solution.'
'B08C9B7PTZ','N/A','N/A','Handle trigger to spray broke after several uses. Built cheap.'
'B08C9B7PTZ','N/A','N/A','I use it to clean my floors and wish I had bought it years ago . I love it so easy to use'
'B08C9B7PTZ','N/A','N/A','Love it. My son has been using it since he was 3. He loves it and I love letting him do the mopping. I will say if the food is really stuck I do have to come in with some muscle.'
'B08C9B7PTZ','N/A','N/A','Love the mop and how easy it is to use but the yarn on the pads unravel with one time use on the short side  need to figure out a little better quality on that otherwise I absolutely love it'
