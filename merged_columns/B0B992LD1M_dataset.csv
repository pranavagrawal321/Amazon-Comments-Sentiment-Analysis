'B0B992LD1M','Cushion shape','3.0 out of 5 stars','Poor cushions filling look very odd.it should be double fiber required'
'B0B992LD1M','Good product','4.0 out of 5 stars',ADDING A BIT TO My REVIEW:  I bought the product for 8500 rupees and shockingly the price has been increased to 10500 rupees. This is outrageous.  The product is very good. It's very comfortable. 3 people can sit freely and 4 people can sit by adjusting. No damage found. Memory foam is good. 2 people with one child can sleep freely once converted in to bed. 3 pillows is a additional attraction. Will buy it again.
