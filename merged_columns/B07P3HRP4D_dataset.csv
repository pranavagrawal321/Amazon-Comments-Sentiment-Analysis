'B07P3HRP4D','Better than expected','4.0 out of 5 stars',"I thought it was going to be like regular quality playing cards found in local stores but to my surprise the quality of the cards are incredible, i dont know what it's made out of but I can tell you that it is not made of regular thin cardboard that easily wears out overtime. It would make the product better if the prints on the cards are a bit more saturated."

'B07P3HRP4D','Quality not upto mark','3.0 out of 5 stars',At first I liked the print quality and overall cards.

'B07P3HRP4D','Costly for this quality....','3.0 out of 5 stars',They look pretty good and shiny glowing in picture but for real they look very cheap type... Material is plastic for sure but of very thin quality... Print doesn't look that glossy too... Most imp. Back side of cards are completely blank.... Pitch dark...
