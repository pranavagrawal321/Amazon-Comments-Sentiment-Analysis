'B079YFGSXQ','Good knife for beginners','4.0 out of 5 stars',"First off, this is a knife made for specific purpose to be used in specific manner. Some reviews suggest it loses sharpness after a few uses and rusts. Considering the price range, it is good enough.  No knife in the world is going to retain it's sharpness for long without sharpening. So, invest in a sharpening stone and learn to sharpen the knife with it.  Do not keep the knife wet or in humid conditions. Always rinse/wash after every use and dry it thoroughly after every wash.  This knife is for beginners who are learning cutting skills. After they have honed their skills, they can move on to better knifes like Victorinox or Cartini.  Overall good quality knife for beginners to learn."

'B079YFGSXQ','Nice knife, could be better','4.0 out of 5 stars''This feels like a good knife but I dont get a good amount of confidence wiedling it. I could be a sharper sometimes it doesnt make a clean cut veggies stick to it a lot which feels odd.. Overall this is still better than the other knifes out there in the same budget. The material fit and finish feel good. This seems a good option to train on before moving more expensive knife sets..'

'B079YFGSXQ','A GOOD KNIFE','4.0 out of 5 stars','This is the best of the lot of the various knives that I have purchased recently. Rest of the knives only harped about sharpness balance and et all but those were just gas. Though this knife is far far superior to other knives that I have bought from Amazon it still needs a bit of weight. The blade is sharp and I hope it remains sharp for a long time. I would be happy if Amazon or its customers can suggest a GOOD KNIFE SHARPENER in order assit sharpening the knives that I have in my kitchen. This knife from Amazon brand Salimi is a great value for money knife given my recent experiences in buying them from other brands/ sellers.'
