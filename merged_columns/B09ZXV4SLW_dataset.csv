'B09ZXV4SLW','Bold liner','4.0 out of 5 stars',The media could not be loaded. I was quite surprised such bold colour in just one stroke especially at this price range. Yes it was smudge proof but I'm not sure if your face is oily then probably it'll smudge. Not water proof. It doesn't wear off when water is poured bt when smudged with water it easily wears off.
