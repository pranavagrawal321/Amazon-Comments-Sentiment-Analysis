'B00UTJG63C','Quality product by Navneet','4.0 out of 5 stars',These are exceptionally great quality pencils. You won't get to see these normally in local stationary shops. I am hooked to these
'B00UTJG63C','Nice product','5.0 out of 5 stars','Using this product since long. Having good writing comfort. Got this for first time from this platform. Good delivery timing.'
'B00UTJG63C','Nice quality pencils','5.0 out of 5 stars',"The pencils look glamorous. Thanks to its fully black body even the inner woods. This feels premium. Pencils are very slim and it feels like they will be broken if I give pressure on them, but that's not the case. Leads are quite dark but certainly can not be put into the extra dark category. I think DOMS Fusion much darker pencil. Pentonic pencils are much darker with a premium and elegant look. However, Stallion has its own charm with its full blackness. A good purchase indeed"
