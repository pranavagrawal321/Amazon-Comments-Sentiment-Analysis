'B07Y88YW16','Simple product but not impressive','3.0 out of 5 stars',It's fine but not impressive.
'B07Y88YW16','Quality isn‚Äôt good','1.0 out of 5 stars','Within the first 7 days I observed that the colour of the rings started to wear off and it looked more like rusted. Also i had to pierce holes in the belt according to my size. The given holes make the belt way too loose. I just wore it twice in these 6 months. I dont think it is worth the price.'

'B07Y88YW16','Good one','5.0 out of 5 stars','Good'
'B07Y88YW16','Not much holes in it','3.0 out of 5 stars',"Free size is quite problematic because it doesn't provides you much holes. My size is 30, and I needed to do three extra holes to carry the belt. Plus the buckle is a bit disappointing because it appears like a huge belly at your front, it is not well adjusted. I think this belt will suit the ones who have waist size above 34"
'B07Y88YW16','It is a good product','5.0 out of 5 stars','Money Worth'
'B07Y88YW16','Great!','4.0 out of 5 stars','I liked this product a lot.You have to do the wholes yourself for the knuckle which is the only issue I have. Rest it is good.'

'B07Y88YW16','Super.','5.0 out of 5 stars',"The quality and thickness of this belt is just amazing, and gives a very classy look. As you can see in the pictures it's just a bit long and has very few holes, so you'll need to makes and new holes in it or adjust as per your size requirement, also the quality of the buckle is superb. Don't even think twice and just go for it, this won't disappoint you for sure. #amazon.in"
'B07Y88YW16','Nice product','5.0 out of 5 stars','Nice product'
'B07Y88YW16','Not for waist exceeding size 36','2.0 out of 5 stars','The media could not be loaded. The answers in the review mentioned that it can used by someone who is having waist of size 40. But that not possible. The total length of belt is 47.5 inch(Shown in video). So one must measure their waist by a measuring tape before buying this. Also the seller should mention the exact length of belt in product description'
'B07Y88YW16','bad experience','1.0 out of 5 stars','got nothing like tag or bill and all stuff just belt and packaging was too bad and now facing difficulties to return because of not receiving tag with package and all bad experience with the product üëéüëéüëéüëé'

'B07Y88YW16','Worst buy','1.0 out of 5 stars','Worst quality. The bockless was broken on first day'
'B07Y88YW16','Ok','2.0 out of 5 stars',The color of the buckle fades away otherwise the belt is strong and won't break easily.
'B07Y88YW16','Cheap material','3.0 out of 5 stars','I bought it because it is stylish with cheap rate but I came to know the belt material is not durable for daily use. The material is tearing.'
