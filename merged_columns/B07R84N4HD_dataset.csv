'B07R84N4HD','A must buy if you are a regular party host.','5.0 out of 5 stars','The game is fun and everyone was rolling with laughter. We had so much fun that we played it again and again. Perfect for an only ladies party or a good gang of friends. There are a lot of non-veg shameless answers so it is not for a party where you at hosting your mothers or seniors.'

'B07R84N4HD','Good product. Need intellectual/witty crowd to play this.','5.0 out of 5 stars',"Good quality cards. Although its a good party game, but its not for 'Desi' people who do not have good command over english; or people who would not want to waste time reading and thinking over answers. Apt for people who play Taboo and similar games."

'B07R84N4HD','BEST GAME EVER!!!','5.0 out of 5 stars',"Best Game Ever. I played this game earlier at my friend's house and had thoroughly enjoyed it. I ordered it just before the lockdown started. Since then i've played this game countless times with my family and we enjoy it. There were some awkward moments in the game when playing woth parents, but now we are past that awkwardness and have come closer as a family. Totally recommend it.  The packaging and card quality is brilliant. The cards maintain shape even after playing multiple times and the best part is, that it comes with a few blank cards, so you can send your own answers to the creators (or use them in the game)"
'B07R84N4HD','Amazing Game!','5.0 out of 5 stars',"If you're looking for the perfect Indian alternative to Cards Against Humanity, this is it! The fact that it's customised to our sensibilities actually makes this game funnier. It's a party favourite!"
'B07R84N4HD','Best party game for Indians','5.0 out of 5 stars','Best party game you can buy in India where there is a severe lack of games for the adults. A very novel effort from the creators. Apart from the content being downright hilarious the cards themselves are made really well and is of great quality. It can seriously take a beating and will come out good. And that too for such a great price.'
'B07R84N4HD','Great product - Had a good time playing it','4.0 out of 5 stars','Played with my friends over a party  had a great time . I would recommend it and play with a larger group of 6-8 friends over drinks'

'B07R84N4HD','SUCH AN AMAZING GAME!! A MUST HOUSE PARTY GAME!!','5.0 out of 5 stars','Played it at a friends house party instantly ordered it the very same moment.'
'B07R84N4HD','Amazing game','5.0 out of 5 stars',"Picked up this card game for a friend's party - lots of cards, relatable indian content, the box is sturdy and packaging is kickass! Over-all value for money, good gifting option."
'B07R84N4HD','Boring! Lacks humor and creativity. Below average product','1.0 out of 5 stars','Disappointed! Below average product in terms of creativity. You tend to get bored even in large group after few rounds. Not at all witty. Avoid purchase.'
'B07R84N4HD','Not my cup of tea I guess!','1.0 out of 5 stars','Way to vulgar content original one is so much better'
'B07R84N4HD','Fun','5.0 out of 5 stars','Amazing and funny'
'B07R84N4HD','Funny AF','5.0 out of 5 stars','An extremely hilarious party game. Can be given as a gift to friends as an alternative to routine card games.'
'B07R84N4HD',Not worthful. Don't buy,'1.0 out of 5 stars','Ordinary game. Nothing special. Easy and boring question. It has nothing like adult game.'
'B07R84N4HD','Good content great game','4.0 out of 5 stars','I Havent been able to play it yet. But I had sorted out the question and answer cards so far the content is nice its not crass and its a bit tamer than the content and language of social humour which was not my cup of tea. Havent played the game with my friends yet but will be doing so soon. Its going to be a hit I am sure.  The packaging was great and the card quality is also up to makr so no its aces in my books.  Price maybe could be a bit less but this categories of games with relevant content to us is scarce so I guess the price can be justified a bit.  Ultimately if you are looking for something a bit decent language-wise and content-wise but still entertaining would recommend to buy this game.'
'B07R84N4HD','Great for house parties!','5.0 out of 5 stars',"Got this as a gift for my friend's Christmas party and ended up playing it all through the night. The cards are super relevant, content is top notch. The packaging and card quality is good too. A little pricey in my opinion. Definitely buying another deck for myself - hope there are expansion packs!  I've been a fan of CAH over the years but the game never lasted long as we hardly got the references. Also played a game called social humour before but personally found it to be crass, sexist and honestly just cheap. Found CvS content tp be much more refined."
'B07R84N4HD','Great game','5.0 out of 5 stars','Great game'

'B07R84N4HD','Is this game fun to play ?','5.0 out of 5 stars','Hell YES! This game is the perfect PARTY GAME to play amongst adults who are comfortable with adult/edgy/explicit humor and understand that the fundamental point of this game is to be offensive and HILARIOUS. The rules are easy and as an Indian it feels amazing to see deep referential and culturally relevant content represented in a game. Relatable Representational and R rated!'
