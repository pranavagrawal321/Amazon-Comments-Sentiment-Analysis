'B016I7CVZU','Good','4.0 out of 5 stars',"Material seems to contain Nylon. Thus it's not easily breakable. Serves the purpose. Only downside is that it was sent just in an Amazon brown paper bag without bubble wrap, due to which wherever the bucket was squeezed in transport, have got slight white stretch marks. If it was just plastic, it would have been broken on the way. Thanks to Nylon in it."
'B016I7CVZU','Extremely poor quality','1.0 out of 5 stars',"Please don't buy this bucket.  The plastic is extremely thin. I can guarantee that it will break within a couple of weeks.  It gets delivered with no packaging, other than the brown paper bag used by Amazon. The bucket I ordered was delivered with a dent. It's a pain to return the product.  I expected much better quality from a company like Cello. So disappointed."
