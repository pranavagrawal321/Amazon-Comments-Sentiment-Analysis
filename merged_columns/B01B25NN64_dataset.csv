'B01B25NN64','Too small.. check dimensions before purchase.l','1.0 out of 5 stars','Way too small.. a4 certificates fits exactly.. not even 1 cm space left on both sides.  Cannot keep stick files .. so you can understand the dimensions.  The thread to tie is in the back... this is another drawback... you cannot keep more than 5 to 6 a4 sized papers or certificates in each slot... not at all versatile.  Quality is OK but space is not enough.  Unfortunately I throwed the original bill and package so unable to return.  Chech dimensions before purchase...'

'B01B25NN64','Not worthy for legal professionals','1.0 out of 5 stars',"It would be nice for students but not fit for legal professionals. As the bottom part is not wide enough, papers of standard volumes can not fit or even it fits papers get crumpled. Besides, when the volume grows, size would also increase i.e more than A4 size. Therefore, concept is good but practical sense in manufacturing the product is deficient. Don't get confused with the picture of any products."
