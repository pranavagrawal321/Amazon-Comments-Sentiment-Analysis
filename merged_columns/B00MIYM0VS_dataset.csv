'B00MIYM0VS','Not Best... But Just Okay...!','2.0 out of 5 stars',"As it claims it keeps 24 hrs cold or 24 Hrs Hot. Nothing like that. I usually using to keep hot, but its doesn't stay same hot for all 24 hrs. Its Roughness body tent to slip from hand while pouring. It should be plain it would nice grip. Or there should be some big smooth slots to get firm grip. A bit expensive. Can get other brand with same or less price."
