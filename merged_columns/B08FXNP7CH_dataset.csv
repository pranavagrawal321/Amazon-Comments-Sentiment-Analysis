'B08FXNP7CH','NOT WORTH A BUY','1.0 out of 5 stars',"In look and appearance it is good but the finish is quite slippery while handling. I used it for keeping hot water. I bought it in July,2023. For about a month time from the date of purchase, it worked well as water remained hot inside it from 16 to 18 hours with without any feel of hotness on bottle's outer layer. However, after about a month the outer layer of bottle started getting strongly heated up after filling the hot water in it, and the water inside it getting cold/normal in short time. HENCE, NOT WORTH A BUY. I don't know whether Amazon would now return/exchange/refund amount."

'B08FXNP7CH','Disappointed','1.0 out of 5 stars',Bought this on 25th October 2022. Was good for 3 months. It did hold cold for long time as mentioned... After 3 months it slowly started losing its temperature retaining (hot or cold) capacity.. Now at max 1 to 2 hours it holds the temperature. I spoke with Amazon customer service (after 3 months of purchase). They dont have any idea about the warranty policy and where to complaint (it says Amazon brand and Amazon did not provide warranty information).  I've been an Amazon customer from 1998-99 (USA) and this is my first disappointment with Amazon. I'll not recommend this.
