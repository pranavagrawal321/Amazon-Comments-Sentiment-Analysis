'B09V881F5R',"Broke in first few minutes , it's a fraud !!!!!!",'1.0 out of 5 stars',"So as soon as I bought this product I tried to close it (buckle it ) and I did it according to the steps as mentioned in the photo it broke down because material is very brittle and cheap it will breakdown on experiencing strain and the teeth of the belt cannot go through the material of the belt because it is kind of hard and it does not close so it will break and I am telling you so please don't ever by this and I am also not eligible for the refund because it is now broken and I cannot give less than one star and I feel cheated man , damn . Have a good day . Hare Krsna"
