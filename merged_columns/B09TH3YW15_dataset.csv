'B09TH3YW15','Love the quality, not all colours are good','4.0 out of 5 stars''I absolutely love the feel of the pens and the way they write the only thing I don‚Äôt like is how we didn‚Äôt get to choose the colours but I suppose we have to blame the manufacturer for that one. Either way looks quite professional both on a shirt pocket as well as pinned onto your notebook.'
'B09TH3YW15','Not the Reynolds that Reynolds used to be :(','2.0 out of 5 stars',"The pen has flimsy parts, not just any pen but all the pens. See the image there is a gap in between chrome tip and body of the pen. It is there for all the pens. Pens body is strong and very comfortable to write also. But having a lose part like this destroys the complete aesthetics of the pen. Roritto's pen has better quality compared to the new Reynolds. Bought Reynolds Jetter out of Nostalgia but regret my decision.  If its was not for flimsy part it would have been a show stopper.  PS: The above is my personal opinion. If you are looking a good comfortable pen to write and not bothered about the aesthetics and all, it still is a VERY GOOD PEN!!"

'B09TH3YW15','Nostalgia','3.0 out of 5 stars',"I bought it to re live old days. But unfortunately u won't find the refill on Amazon. Then they have compromised on the quality. Earlier it used to be sturdy. It's all cheap plastic. But then, those people whose prized pen used to be Reynolds jetter, should go for it or the metal version which is much costlier."
