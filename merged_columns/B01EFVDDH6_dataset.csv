'B01EFVDDH6','Not that great product.','2.0 out of 5 stars',Initially mouse worked really well for about 2 months. Now it started giving issues like - mouse pointer is not moving in sync with the hand motion. It gets stuck even though web page or controls are active. I had to rapidly move it to get the mouse pointer moving again. Sometimes it happens during the presentation or screen sharing with my bosses. It's really embarrassing situation. I had to explain that mouse is not working properly. Overall not very happy with product.
