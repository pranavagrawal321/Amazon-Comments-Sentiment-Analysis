'B09P33VNGL','Good quality','5.0 out of 5 stars',I loved it but had to return because the sleeve was too long. Didn't wanna go through the hassle of tailoring it to fit me. The quality is top notch. Would definitely recommend to go for it.
'B09P33VNGL','Quality is not good','2.0 out of 5 stars',Not medium blue as described. It's Navy Blue. Looking like school uniform cloth. Tailored fit and lining cloth etc everything is good. Ã‘ot to my expectations
'B09P33VNGL','Overall good product 1 who is finding blazer under 2500 i will suggest this','3.0 out of 5 stars','I have received this product at 2400 Rs size 38 . Very nice In this prise range. Material quality is also good.only bad thing is that there was poor packaging seller and flipcart should take care of this thing..they sent blazzer in polythen due to that some wrinkles are there on the blazer.They should pack in a box bevause its a blazer and peter england should maintain some standard. Overall good product in this price range. Blindly you can go for it.'
