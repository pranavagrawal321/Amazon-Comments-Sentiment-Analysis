'B006LXDVTM','A GOOD MOISTURIZING DEODORANT','4.0 out of 5 stars',I started to use this product 1 month ago and to be honest I really liked how moisturizing it is. I loved the scent of this product. But the think I hate about this product is that it claims that is whitens your underarm but it doesn't however it is good for long lasting moisture.
