'B0736T6DCC','N/A','N/A','Not the best quality but great if you have lightweight cutlery that feels flimsy in your hand'
'B0736T6DCC','N/A','N/A',Sono un po' troppo grossi.
'B0736T6DCC','N/A','N/A','After using the nice a few times and using the dishwasher to clean them they became doll and food still got stuck in between the grooves. I don’t recommend this product.'
'B0736T6DCC','N/A','N/A','Stamped “Amazon basic 13/0 stainless steel Made in China.” Solid and well made. Great price. The quality is excellent. I recommend.'
'B0736T6DCC','N/A','N/A','Good knives other than the above'
'B0736T6DCC','N/A','N/A','Proper knives that actually work'

'B0736T6DCC','N/A','N/A','These tables knives were better than I anticipated they are heavy duty and a great addition to my flatware collection. I just needed knives because mine have disappeared and these are great.'
'B0736T6DCC','N/A','N/A','After a month they are already beginning to rust on the serrations after using the dish washer.'
'B0736T6DCC','N/A','N/A',"'Please don\'t judge me as a shallow person after reading this.  I have two sets of cutlery at home. One for day to day use and another for when we have company.  These butter knives are really nice looking. Just as good as my ""nice"" set. Expensive looking large good finish heavy and well made. However I have two issues with these  1) These are too bulky for little kids to be spreading peanut butter on toast. The cheaper lighter knives are much easier for little hands to handle 2) I can\'t use these for special occasions either. They\'re stamped ""Amazon basics"" right on the blade'"
'B0736T6DCC','N/A','N/A','great value for the price. Will buy again.'
'B0736T6DCC','N/A','N/A','Je ne recommande pas ces couteaux Très mauvaises qualités. Après 2e lavage ya de la rouille sur mes couteaux. Dommage je les aimais'
'B0736T6DCC','N/A','N/A','Order this multiple time during last 2 years for my workplace as cutlery get lost or accidently toss in trash. It used multiple time in a day passing thru dishwasher many times and still stay shiny for many weeks also the price is good compare to other similar quality products.'
'B0736T6DCC','N/A','N/A','Sorprendido con material y su terminacion. Buen balance buen corte aunque claramente no es para carne. Se ven lindas en la mesa sobre todo con el combo completo con tenedor y cucharas.'
'B0736T6DCC','N/A','N/A','These are very sturdy knives. Nice sized handle. Wash well in the dishwasher. I would buy these again. Hopefully these won’t disappear like the rest of my tableware has.'
'B0736T6DCC','N/A','N/A','They rusted the first time we put them in the dishwasher. Need to hand wash them and dry them right away.'
'B0736T6DCC','N/A','N/A','These are a great value quality product that has the right weight in the hand when usedand feels great.'
'B0736T6DCC','N/A','N/A','Sturdy and easy to use'
'B0736T6DCC','N/A','N/A','Top ware'
'B0736T6DCC','N/A','N/A',''
'B0736T6DCC','N/A','N/A','Recommend for every day use'
'B0736T6DCC','N/A','N/A',I'm disappointed. They're completely ruined after about a year of regular use and washing.
'B0736T6DCC','N/A','N/A',It's a butter knife. Smooth edges on the handle. Purposely dull serrations and a good heft.  Feel is important to me and these feel good.  If you can afford to support a company other than Amazon do that but these are cheap price and good quality. If I ever upgrade I'll gift them or keep them for camping
'B0736T6DCC','N/A','N/A','Too long to fit in a standard flat Rubbermaid cutlery tray.'
'B0736T6DCC','N/A','N/A','Good quality product for the price I use them at my restaurant'
'B0736T6DCC','N/A','N/A','These butter knives were exactly as described! Really heavyweight and the pricing was excellentl. For everyday use as I destroyed all my butter knives from my everyday utensils using them as screwdrivers. Go figure.'
'B0736T6DCC','N/A','N/A',"I cannot say enough about this product. I expected so much less quality for the price. I'm going to replace my entire silverware set with this brand and style, It is beautiful and heavy, it really seems valuable."
'B0736T6DCC','N/A','N/A','Very tacky'
'B0736T6DCC','N/A','N/A','very well made price is great'
'B0736T6DCC','N/A','N/A','These are fine but I would be more enthusiastic if the were not Amazon branded. None of my other place settings have visible branding.'
'B0736T6DCC','N/A','N/A','I can only assume these were designed while working from home and no one actually held one. They’re too big. Unbalanced. Heavy. Worst of all they don’t cut. Not even toast. As a cutting implement they’re useless. I mostly use them as a butter knife and to rip through toast.'
'B0736T6DCC','N/A','N/A','does what they were meant too but... too bulky'
'B0736T6DCC','N/A','N/A','It rusts after little use .garbage'
'B0736T6DCC','N/A','N/A',I liked the heavy feel of the knives but every knife had multiple rust spots after washing in the dishwasher. I'm going to return.
'B0736T6DCC','N/A','N/A','I was amazed on how nice these are.'
'B0736T6DCC','N/A','N/A','Nothing.'
'B0736T6DCC','N/A','N/A','They’re too long for my silverware tray and they have very heavy handles. They look nice though!'
'B0736T6DCC','N/A','N/A',"'I PURCHASED THESE BUTTER KNIVES BECAUSE MY ORGINAL FULL SET ""LOST A FEW KNIVES"" SO I HAVE THEM AS A FILL IN AND THEY ARE WORKING AND CLEANING PERFECTLY...NO COMPLAINTS'"
'B0736T6DCC','N/A','N/A','These are solid & sturdy. They wash up great in the dishwasher.'
'B0736T6DCC','N/A','N/A','Just started using these. They are nice and heavy but they are already getting rust spots.'
'B0736T6DCC','N/A','N/A','todo bien. ok'
'B0736T6DCC','N/A','N/A','disappointed with these knives. mine has rust spots within 4-5 had to throw them away.'
'B0736T6DCC','N/A','N/A','These dinner knives are a great compliment to our drawer.'
