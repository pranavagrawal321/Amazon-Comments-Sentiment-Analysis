'B089WB69Y1','DO NOT BUY!!','1.0 out of 5 stars','With approx. 16K reviews and a 4* star rating I thought this was a no brainer and a pretty safe buy. This is an unreliable product  in just a few days it seems to have failed I would get up in the morning and find my devices not charged  I thought maybe the connection to the plug was a problem. When this persisted for a few days i gave it a closer look the PD USB-C port is unable to charge a device  when connected it shows charging for a few seconds and then stops. Alas I am out of the return window.'
