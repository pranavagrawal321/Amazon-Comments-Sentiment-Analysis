'B09H27WGZF','Light, small nakiri. Gets the job done. Could be better.',"'3.0 out of 5 stars'The media could not be loaded. Overall, this nakiri knife will get the job done, however you may wish it was a few grams heavier.  Do remember, nakiri is a knife for greens/veggies - please don't confuse it with a meat cleaver. Nakiri knives are to be used only with veggies, it is not a general purpose knife - it should NOT be used with bones, seeds, hard shells.  I am reviewing this as a nakiri knife. A few points to note: 1. I found it to be light 2. The knife was decently sharp out of the box - however, the edge was too rough ground for my taste and needed polishing - pic attached. 3. The heel/finger guard section definitely needed sand papering - was uncomfortably rough - pic attached. 4. There were two unnecessary sharp points/tips in my opinion - again those needed sand papering - pic attached. 5. The balance of the blade - I'd have preferred a bit more towards the tang/handle - see the video. With such a light blade, a lean towards the front of the blade felt a bit off.  The handle was decent with a grippy texture. It did not feel slippery at all, and is the right size for the blade. For the price, I think the knife needs more weight and at least one more finishing step, where they smooth out the unnecessary rough bits/edges before they package the knife."

'B09H27WGZF','Super knife','5.0 out of 5 stars',"Man, it's so good. Am just amazed with its sharpness. Earlier i used only crystal brands knives. Even today, i am a big fan of Crystal. Never satisfied with any other brand except this one. This is very light weight and very suitable for vegetable cutting. But as it's very sharp and light weight u should be careful while using this."
'B09H27WGZF','Kachaaaaao','5.0 out of 5 stars','This is a very good Blade. it chops nicely and get htings done. After a few days the blade is not sharpen anymore as it get dull. But I boought a Sand Stone 1000 and after few wacking it comes back to razor shaarp.  Its very dangerous as if it fals on you feet then you might get hurt.  Dont pickup speed with it so fast as it will cut your finger.  Its a Must Buy.. If you are the one who want to chop tomato withought making juice out of them.'

'B09H27WGZF','Very sharp and good knife','5.0 out of 5 stars',"I want to clarify for the newbies here this is a professional chef knife, so it needs to be sharpen on a regular basis that means atleast one a month, plus cut it carefully it's very sharp and a slightest mistake can literally cut your finger. I have bought rupper caps for my fingers along with it to protect my fingers.  I had accidentally cut my thumb ( not completely but a cut) it cut half of my nail. So use it with precaution and keep it at a safe distance from your hand."
