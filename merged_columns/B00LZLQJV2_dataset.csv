'B00LZLQJV2',It's good,'5.0 out of 5 stars',It's quite expensive for a notebook but the durability and the paper is good I mean I have used it as my journal and it's best option.
'B00LZLQJV2','Best notebook that I have ever used for note taking.','5.0 out of 5 stars',I used to write on a4 size papers that are for printing and make spiral notebooks of them but I never wanted to revise from that notebook. I don't know but something just didn't feel right with them. Then I came across this notebook. Its page size was one of the best selling points for me. 400 pages are enough for 1 theoretical subject.  I really like it.

'B00LZLQJV2','Perfect diary','5.0 out of 5 stars',"The media could not be loaded. Good size, pages, single line , 5 divisions ,nice book mark.. Absolutely fantastic in this prize . It doesn't have contact list pages. Which I really didn't need. So all my pages can be used as per my wish. Also not date / month orientated pages like to do diary. So loved exactly I was looking for."

'B00LZLQJV2','Good quality','4.0 out of 5 stars',The paper quality is good and the cover is really thick so that the book won't get spoiled at all.
'B00LZLQJV2','Excellent quality for the price','5.0 out of 5 stars',"The note book is unbelievable quality for the price . You can blindly go for it . Remember you cannot select the book cover and it's not the same what is displayed. I got a different one too but luckily the design was even better from what is shown in the pictures . It's good for everyday use like taking notes, practicing etc. Might not be good for drawing/ colouring in sketch pen, brush pen etc. I m using it with dark ink fountain pen hence bit of ghosting is there but definitely not a deal breaker. The paper is very smooth and pleasant, the pen just glides on it . Great value for money."

'B00LZLQJV2','Faulty Binding Note book from papercraft','2.0 out of 5 stars','Binding is not intact-Book is not sturdy. Didn‚Äôt expect this from papercraft. Not satisfied with product'
'B00LZLQJV2','More pros than cons. Value for money.','5.0 out of 5 stars',"Gorgeous notebook! It's nice, big and sturdy. Larger than A5 and shorter in length than A4, which is exactly the size I prefer for journalling. The lines are not too close to each other like in other school notebooks and that's a bonus for me. The top got a little smushed during the transit but it's not a big issue. The ink/writing shows on the backside but it's not a deal breaker for me because once you write on the backside, the visibility of the first side isn't prominent. Overall a great purchase!"
'B00LZLQJV2','Quality','5.0 out of 5 stars','Quality is great'
'B00LZLQJV2','Worth it','4.0 out of 5 stars',"So when I write with a ball pen, it ghosts on tje other side. But it isn't too much. It's a size between A4 and AT I feel. I think it's perfect. It's 400 pages for 200 bucks! I think it's a good deal. I'm using it to learn ÌïúÍµ≠Ïñ¥ (korean). You can use it for whatever."
