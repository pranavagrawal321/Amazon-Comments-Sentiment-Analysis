'B0929P7NT1',üö®üö®üö®Don't buy after seeing huge discount,'1.0 out of 5 stars',"This product always comes with heavy discounts. Think before you buy otherwise you will face the issue as I have seen. After continuous uses of 1month, rust is appearing in the cap of the bottles small but more after using. So, you can understand that it's just a cheap material not a stainless steel. How unhygienic it is hope you all know. And now I am unable to return it also as return period was just 10days. For me, it's a health threating item and money are also wasted.  Last, it's up to you if you want this type of product for your healthy lifestyle."
