'B00P93X0VO','Paper quality is not good','1.0 out of 5 stars','The media could not be loaded. The quality of paper is not good and very thin like newspaper.'

'B00P93X0VO','Good fountain pen friendly notebook from classmate','5.0 out of 5 stars',"The media could not be loaded. I wanted to purchase an inexpensive fountainpen friendly notebook and came across this Classmate pulse series of notebooks. They are advertised as premium spiral bound notebooks with 60 GSM ALFA Bright paper made by ITC so I went ahead with this. Genuinely surprised by the quality. For the price, the paper doesn't bleed ink even with wet writers, I used a wet guider pen with medium schmidt nib and bril ink, you can find the attached video. The paper is thin and there is slight ghosting but it is not as severe as the regular classmate notebooks. You can find the comparison for the same attached to this review. The spiral binding is also very easy to use and convinient when laying flat on the table. Overall a really good value for money notebook."
'B00P93X0VO','Too small.','1.0 out of 5 stars',"Of course the measurements are in milimetres, who has the time to calculate that? No returns available. If you're not buying this for your kid, then go for a bigger size, and it's better to buy such things offline. Easy measurements should be provided, now I will have to live with 4 worthless notebooks."

'B00P93X0VO','Too small ü•≤','1.0 out of 5 stars','Dislike'
'B00P93X0VO','Pay attention to size before ordering','3.0 out of 5 stars','Bought several A4 size notebooks of this brand and when ordered again the order went to smaller size ones. Unfortunately these are non returnable items. So if you see a sale on this product it just fraud due to smaller size and not because of sale. Wrong sizes types and models are getting inserted in between the legitimate Amazon search results last few weeks. The company and product name and photos are exactly same but the size type and/or model varies after you order them and these non returnable. This wasn‚Äôt a serious problem earlier.'

'B00P93X0VO','Worth the price','5.0 out of 5 stars','Many pages medium size note book. Good quality'
'B00P93X0VO','Good','4.0 out of 5 stars',The cover was different than the one given in the photo. I choose this one among the others only because the cover and it was not the same. Only post photo of the product that you have or you are selling. Otherwise the quality of paper was of course good because it's classmate.
'B00P93X0VO','Good quality, love the colour pages in between',"'5.0 out of 5 stars'The media could not be loaded. I have to agree the cost is high, but all classmate products' price is super high. It has 5 or 6 colour pages in between as recorded in video. Paper quality is so and so. Classmate paper quality has greatly degraded compared to 10 years back. Compact note, size is smaller compared to long size notebook. But we get more pages. The binding is like spiral binded plastic sheet. Best for college, single note 5 subs."
'B00P93X0VO','stylish','5.0 out of 5 stars','SO soft and absolutely nice to handle .stylish and soft in writing too.'

'B00P93X0VO','Professional and Organized - Classmate Pulse 6 Subject Notebook Impresses!','5.0 out of 5 stars',"The Classmate Pulse 6 Subject Notebook is a well-designed and professional-looking notebook that has been a valuable addition to my organizational arsenal. With its unruled pages, spiral binding, and generous page count, this notebook has helped me stay on top of my tasks and notes with ease.  The first thing that caught my attention was the sleek and sophisticated appearance of the notebook. The cover has a professional yet modern design, and the size (240mm*180mm) is perfect for carrying around without being too bulky.  The unruled pages provide ample space for both writing and sketching, making it suitable for a variety of purposes. Whether I need to take notes during meetings or jot down creative ideas, this notebook accommodates my needs exceptionally well.  The spiral binding ensures that the notebook lays flat on any surface, making it easy to write without any discomfort or uneven surfaces. I find this feature incredibly convenient, especially when I'm trying to quickly reference previous notes during a meeting or study session.  The 6 subject dividers are a fantastic addition, allowing me to categorize and organize my notes efficiently. It's perfect for keeping track of different projects, subjects, or any other personal or professional topics.  With 300 pages, this notebook offers an abundance of writing space, and I don't have to worry about running out of pages quickly. The sturdy paper quality also ensures that my writing doesn't bleed through to the other side.  One suggestion for improvement would be to include some perforated pages. Having a few perforated pages would make it easier to tear out and share notes or ideas with others without having to remove them from the notebook."
