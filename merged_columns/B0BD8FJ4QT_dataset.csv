'B0BD8FJ4QT','Think before you buy - Explanation below','2.0 out of 5 stars',"'1. First thing first it\'s small and lightweight 2. You can charge two devices simultaneously 3. It\'s not an original charger. So think twice before buying. 4. I explored that it starts with ""Fast Charging"" and after a few minutes it changes its mode to ""Standard Charging"". So if you are thinking to buy it for charging your supported phone it won\'t help you. My phone supports Fast Charging 33W. But this device working like a normal charger. 5. No support for the device is available. If you face any issue with the product you are gone.'"
