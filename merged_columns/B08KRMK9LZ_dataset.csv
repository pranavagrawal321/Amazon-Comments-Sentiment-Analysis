'B08KRMK9LZ','Good product','4.0 out of 5 stars',It is a good stylus for apple ipads. Currently I have iPad 9th gen and it works with the iPad just like an original apple pencil. But I have 2 issues 1. You can't use it while charging the stylus 2. The single touch on off feature creates lots of problems whith accedental touches. It turns on and off with a slightest touch. I think if it had double touch on off then it will be very good.
