'B08497X176','brightness it is not very very low but still its little bit low overall good at prize','4.0 out of 5 stars',The media could not be loaded. the only problem of this keyboard is the brightness it it really not very bright and overall working properly keys are smooth heavy and durable body good build quality and 3 years warranty also i think this keyboard no need for repaire before 5 years i think it can work for 5 years easyly and it is really good product value for money good membrane keyboard best product at this price it is average for gaming because this keyboard haven't all key hosting and also not bad for basic gaming but not for esports games
'B08497X176','Keyboard is good','4.0 out of 5 stars','Overall keyboard is good but if you want a better look of your keyboard then you can go for any other keyboard because its rgb and backlit whatever it is are very low. Otherwise the keyboard is good except the rgb light. But you can see the letters in dark but you wont feel it. Because it has very low brightness. Except this everything is fine. So if you want a keyboard which looks better in dark too then this keyboard is not for you. You can for go some other OR if you can manage with the low brightness of your keyboard. Then definetly you can go it.'
'B08497X176','Good','5.0 out of 5 stars','Ease to use'
'B08497X176','Cost effective Gaming Keyboard','5.0 out of 5 stars',Keyboard is good for gaming and typing. Keystrokes are soft and no clicks.  Some comments say that the backlight cannot be controlled. But it could be if we read the manual. Fn + num pad 2 will reduce light and turn it off. And Dn+ num pad 8 will increase brightness and further clicks will lead to blinking/breathing  The brightness is enough for a dark room or at night. But it's no point turning it on a day.  Overall you get what you paid for.

'B08497X176','AMAZING KEYBOARD PERIOD','4.0 out of 5 stars',"The media could not be loaded. It's a straight-up loot for a price of 649/- from HP. I'm typing this review with it.  The Goods: - This can be considered a near-perfect silent keyboard. (Was particular for one, just got lucky) - The keys are deep yet soft enough to give the experience of a mechanical keyboard. It's the best of both worlds. (membrane & mechanical) - The breathing LED effect is decent enough to make up for the absence of other RGB modes. - It's a nifty & compact gadget with a very cool touch & feel.  The OKs: - Brightness is less/ moderate but I don't see a reason why it should be any brighter in the dark. - This device needs time to get used to typing, as the keys don't feel precisely in place of your muscle memory. So not 100% ideal for typing right from the start. - I realised after making the purchase that there are no multimedia key icons/ prints on the F-keys, but they thankfully work. (Read the manual) - The keyboard's legs/tilt brackets could have been way taller for more inclination and ease of typing. I might probably 3D print them later.  It's a purchase you won't regret like I didn't. Cheers!"

'B08497X176',"'THE BEST ~ press ""F"" for respect'",'5.0 out of 5 stars',"Excellent keyboard, excellent keyboard, I just can not believe how they have managed to sell this for 699, even if they were selling it at 1200-1300 I would have not cared it at all, great key stabilization, great feel and feedback obviously can't compare with keyboards of more than 1600-1700, but mannn 699???... You gotta be kidding me. Yes the rgb backlight is not very bright but sufficient for dim rooms, and what?... Great feel and feedback, excellent build quality, even when trying to bend it, it wasn't flexing.  Note: This keyboard doesn't support anti ghosting, upto 4 key presses can be registered which is not good for competitive gaming for example CSGO but, casual gaming and games like GTA 5 and similar will work flawlessly."

'B08497X176','First HP Keyboard.','5.0 out of 5 stars','I thought the price of this Keyboard is so High afterall this is a membrane keyboard but I was so wrong. Actually the Quality the lights and The Experience is Much Better than I thought. Also the build quality is awesome. This is strong slightly heavy and the elevation is Also good. The most important is the typing experience which is much much better. But being a Gaming Keyboard the led lights are not that Bright and there is only Breathing mode and 3 type of brightness and end. So I am Satisfied with the build quality and the Typing experience except The LED Backlit. Whatever Thank You Amazon for having this Budget Gaming Keyboard in your Stock.'
