'B07WZLFWP6','Great notebook','4.0 out of 5 stars','The notebooks were packed very well and I received them in excellent condition. The page and grid print quality is good too. The edges are rounded to avoid accidental scratches from the plastic covers although the back cover sometimes comes off the spiral. Many kinds of pens worked fine without ghost lines. Reducing one star for the price!'
'B07WZLFWP6','Quality','5.0 out of 5 stars','Good and quality product'
'B07WZLFWP6',It's worth the money,'5.0 out of 5 stars',I'm glad I found this!
'B07WZLFWP6','Page might be below 100gsm','5.0 out of 5 stars',"Go for it. Don't think twice. Although page is below 100gsm because I have Neorah 100gsm journal and that's page is way thicker. So I think it's 80gsm, maybe. But This is not an excuse to not buy this product. 100gsm from my diary is more than necessary thick whick makes me write only most important things there (to preserve and use properly high quality thick page). Square grid will make your weiting small, so you will write same amout of alphabic letters here (A5) as you write in A4. Just don't use cursive, and leave no blank line in between and you will save more pages for future and your handwriting will also look much better than cursive. Summary: It's perfectly balanced, as everything should be."

'B07WZLFWP6','N/A','N/A','Im so tired of cheap graph paper that you highlight and immediately runs right through the paper. Taking four summer classes and this is perfect for keeping me organized. Keeping this in my list so I can buy for each semester. You will not be disappointed if you‚Äôre an organization freak like myself.'

'B07WZLFWP6','N/A','N/A',"I'm a stationery nerd with a crazy backlog of probably 50+ new notebooks of all sorts languishing on my shelves, silently judging me, but when I want a practical, value-for-cost utilitarian notebook that nevertheless has excellent paper, I turn to these. I've gone through at least six so far!  Paper is thicker than Rhodia (usually 80 gsm) and more absorbent (also slightly less surface-smooth), so fountain pen inks won't sheen much, but it doesn't seem to feather at all even with a wet pen and inks dry quickly. Perfect for quick notes! The mid-tone gray grid ruling is perfect, too, a goldilocks size and color, neither obtrusively dark nor eyestrain light. The plastic cover is sturdy too and provides a flat stiff writing surface anywhere - can repurpose as a hard, toothy shitajiki pencil board! Really, so many good, no-nonsense things about this notebook. Maybe one minor weakness is the spiral binding which can warp and which the paper does catch now and then when turning a page, but it's hard to demand that level of detail engineering in a ~$5 notebook (in the 3-pack). Nearly 200 words about a notebook. Like I said, nerd. But please humor me, I'm harmless.  TL;DR: Excellent value, good everyday quality, works with fountain pens."
