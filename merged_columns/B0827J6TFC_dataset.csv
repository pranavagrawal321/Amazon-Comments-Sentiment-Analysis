'B0827J6TFC','Keyboard is good but some common features not available','3.0 out of 5 stars',"* Function key and shortcuts like volume,next-prev button etc not available . This Functions are available in cheap keyboard also. * On/off switch is not available. It will consume too much battery. You can't set off in a break. You can't disconnect with PC. * Power saver functionality isnot available.If keyboard isn't in use for a few min it should disable automatically.  If it don't have above common features, it seems too costly."

'B0827J6TFC','No keyboard turn on/off button','1.0 out of 5 stars','The keyboard operates continuously without the ability to be toggled on or off. This unceasing functionality is a core user expectation when utilizing a laptop or computer. However this perpetual operation mode can lead to frequent battery replacements due to the constant power consumption.'

'B0827J6TFC','Amazing!','5.0 out of 5 stars',"This keyboard provided by HP is USB based, connects via 2.4GHz band. You just need to plug the small USB adaptor (wireless) to your pc and the laptop starts working smoothly.  It works on AAA battery, which is provided along with the product. It has two stands on its backside which provides an elevated platform for you to type.  It has 3 led's for Caps Lock, Num Lock and the battery. Overall I found the typing to be smooth, and this product to be worth the money."
'B0827J6TFC','Poor quality and flimsy product from hp','1.0 out of 5 stars','Stay away at any cost. This is good if your child wants to use it. Otherwise stick to a regular logitech full size keyboard. Extremely flimsy and bad quality of plastic.'
'B0827J6TFC','Ergonomic wireless and soft','5.0 out of 5 stars',I thought it is wired keyboard but as expected and described it wireless keyboard only. As I have already a wireless mouse so I wanted to buy a keyboard only and it meets my expectation. Very soft keys and it's price is around 800. That makes it ergonomical and easy to buy. Thank you hp.
