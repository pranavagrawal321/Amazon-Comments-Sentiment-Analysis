'B07RX67CG2','N/A','N/A',"My WFH set up is very low to the ground and I've been looking for a floor chair to pair with the foldaway table I use. While this chair isn't also foldable (which would have been cool), it ended up not being necessary. The cushion isn't the best for spending long periods of time sitting on it as I do, so I did add a second one. But for normal periods, it's not bad. Fairly easy to put together."
'B07RX67CG2','N/A','N/A','I purchased 2 of this. The first one we put together cracked in a few places. The second one had a hole drilled off center soit did not line up with the screw. The second one also had small cracks in a couple places and one larger crack. And some of the screws (all tightened during assembly) are coming back out - without being used. The chairs are not worth the price IMO.'
'B07RX67CG2','N/A','N/A','Product was shipped from China and missing vital pieces for assembly.'
'B07RX67CG2','N/A','N/A','Ordered two both came with missing parts. Leg of the chair had a crack. Had to return.'
'B07RX67CG2','N/A','N/A',"'Was initially thrilled with this and I purchased the large size for my wife who is petite and medium frame. This is not suitable for an average person probably designed for Asian frame persons.  The design is quite flimsy and the lats don\'t appear sturdy and seem to bow when a person sits on it with crossed legs for mediation. The cushion is extremely thin and you can feel the lats through it hurt your bottom.  Assembly was a challenge with so many screws and the slots to insert the lats are not deep to and barely sit 1/4"" in to the groove. Use a power drill but make sure you turn the last two threads by the small hex key they provide (and is a challenge on your fingers) Holes are not centric hence the screws tend to tear into the wood especially the two back curvature pieces so its tricky how to fit these with our tearing up the lat.  Not worth $129 feels more like a $30 chair for your toddler I would have kept it for chuckles. Look for something better and comfortable. I decided to make a full size sturdies with Select Pine wood so this one goes back to Amazon.'"
'B07RX67CG2','N/A','N/A','Really bad quality for the price. The wood cracked in various places after tightening the screws and sitting on the chair. Screws also have to be tightened well or the chair becomes lopsided. Annoying yo assemble. Some of the pre drilled holes weren’t drilled appropriately. Completely disappointed. I should’ve bought the cheaper replica on AliExpress'
'B07RX67CG2','N/A','N/A',"I struggled a little with the installation but finally did it. The cushion can be thicker and should be secured with velcro strips so that it doesn't slide back. Chair runs small. I ordered a large but fits perfectly for a petite person. A small would be for children. Other than that, it's an adorable little meditation chair."
'B07RX67CG2','N/A','N/A','Not hard to assemble but painful. Screws show. Would’ve been nice if the seat pads could’ve strapped in.'
'B07RX67CG2','N/A','N/A','The product is not as advertised. Over priced'
'B07RX67CG2','N/A','N/A','I sent it back was total garbage'
'B07RX67CG2','N/A','N/A',"Perfect height, comfort, look... the only issue is two of the slats cracked during assembly. Like other reviewers have said, putting together the pieces was a challenge. When I went to tighten all of the screws, the bamboo fractured (as you can see in the photos). Still usable but I worry about the chair's longevity and for the price I consider it an investment."
'B07RX67CG2','N/A','N/A',"Not sure why I paid so much for this, I guess I was desperate to find a cool looking low sitting chair. It's sturdy for sitting, but can't really stand on it, you'll feel the wood bend. I mean it's not for standing anyways, but just saying. It seems over-priced for around $120-$130, but I guess it looks kind of cool to have."
'B07RX67CG2','N/A','N/A',"This chair is a cute design. I brought it to sit infront of a coffee table; to occassionally do paperwork. First, for the price, I was expecting a much higher grade of materials. I do not know if some Bamboos are a better cut than others but this Bamboo seems very low grade and flimsy. The hardware is inexpensive, soft metal and needs a special hex-head driver to fasten into place. This may require a special trip to the hardware store. Assembly requires hand setting about 40 of these scews. Yes, 40! The screws are a silver color, so they do not compliment the wood tone. The guide holes are recessed and there are no hole plugs to hide the silver screws. Unless you read Japanese you will not understand the instructions. They are literally written in Japanese and no other lanquage. It's easy enough to fiqure out what you need to do from the pictures. I know to never tighten down hardware at any one attachment point for any project. So, I carefully set the pieces in place and partially secured each piece and then went back, and in a cross pattern method tightened down each screw. Yes, this may mean you need to take some Ibuprofen or Acetaminophen for your hands. The last straw however was when one of the Bamboo slats split as I was secuing it in to place. That's a deal breaker. I am not spending 129.00 on something to have the wood split under normal conditions. I did finish the assembly and sat in the chair. It's ok, but I was so afraid that all the wood slats would split, break and or crack at any moment I could not enjoy sitting in it. So, it is definitely going back."
'B07RX67CG2','N/A','N/A',"For what we paid for each chair, we didn't expect to have to put it together like a jenga puzzle. The chair requires COMPLETE assembly. None of the parts come pre-assembled. And since not all of the pieces fit together perfectly (some of the rods are a bit too big/too tight), you need a hammer to wedge them in and a couple of extra hands to hold it all together while you insert and tighten the screws. And there are A LOT of screws.Oh, and the cushions are super super flat and not very comfortable. If you are larger than a twelve year old, don't bother. Wish I'd bought the Japanese-style chairs I saw on etsy. They were less expensive yet still didn't require so much work."
'B07RX67CG2','N/A','N/A','Looks like it’s straight out of Japan.'
'B07RX67CG2','N/A','N/A','Product appears decent but after putting the chair 3/4 of the way together discovered one of the wooden slats is cracked.'
