'B07KMXK47B','Good product - sturdy.','5.0 out of 5 stars','This is a robust product. Only issue is passing the belt (either end) through the loops of your jeans.

'B07KMXK47B','Thanks nice product very useful product to me','5.0 out of 5 stars',Quality of the belt is absolutely good. Seems very durable as it is made of Nylon webbing. However the manufacturer could have provided one more extra buckle to prevent hanging extra belt especially those have waist size less than 32/34inch. The belt is very long & strong. Is to use the latch for open & close. Price is little higher side. But since the quality is good I don't mind paying 500 bucks. Helpful Report
