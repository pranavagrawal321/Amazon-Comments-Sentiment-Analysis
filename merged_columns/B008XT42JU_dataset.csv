'B008XT42JU','Long lasting products','5.0 out of 5 stars','If you are looking for quality product that lasts for years go for GM. This is 5th or 6th extension I bought not becuase others were broken but becuase their quality is so good so when I think I remember only two extension boards I have changed in 13 years from this company and one only due to the issue of starting switch (The push button was broken and I was lazy to get it fixed locally).  It is worth the money you spend and I some times run electric drill or high power vacuum cleaner on this which is usually not advisable but it never broke down in year.'

'B008XT42JU','Review after constantly using last 3 years','5.0 out of 5 stars',"I bought this product at jan 2020 Advantage *It have good durability *It have long enough cable length to use in rooms and office *It's design is one of best at price ratio and it do not have useless RGB, it have simple red led for indicator which is good enough and not disturbing in long run like those garbage boards with blue led strips at sides Disadvantage *So forth main disadvantage is its colour it gets dirty after almost every year (I have cleaned it almostin yearly basis,after cleaning it once again becomes new as day 1 *After 3 years I have also cleaned it's internal as it was giving me some problem at ports where dust cap is. it became little laggy, but after cleaning and applying little oil it became once again in brand condition)  If you maintain it well, it works like charm.(just clean it in yearly basis it is good to go) üôÇ"
