'B0931BBTDP','Drastic fall in quality and hike in price','1.0 out of 5 stars',"I have been buying this item for many years from Bata shops. Of late, it is rarely found in the shops. So, I started buying Bata's own online shop. Then it disappeared from there too and was found listed in Amazon. From â‚¹200 odd the price has been unjustifiably increased to â‚¹369. And within about 2 weeks of purchase, wear and tear is observed, while the much older ones are still going strong. I use 3 pairs for different parts of my home and garden. So, I keep replacing once in a few months and hence, I am able to tell the deterioration in quality. I have decided to say good bye to these and will switch over to another brand that offers better quality."
