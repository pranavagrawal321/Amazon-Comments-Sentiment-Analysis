'B07YNHHH5N','Reduced hair loss.','5.0 out of 5 stars',I've been using it since two weeks and I've noticed a definitive reduction in hair loss. It makes the hair smoother than any of the shampoos I've used earlier. Long term results are yet to be seen.
'B07YNHHH5N','Worst experience ever','1.0 out of 5 stars',I ordered a 100ml bottle for trial seeing the huge reviews of the 1 ltr pack.

Would not recommend even to my enemy.
