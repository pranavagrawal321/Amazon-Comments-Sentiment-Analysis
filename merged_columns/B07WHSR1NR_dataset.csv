'B07WHSR1NR','PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS OR ANY MOBILE PHONES FROM AMAZON','1.0 out of 5 stars',I bought this a week ago. And stopped working.

'B07WHSR1NR','IQOO is an unpopular brand!','2.0 out of 5 stars',"The first two months of using this phone were smooth , all was working well. Unfortunately, from the third month it all went downhill. The phone constantly lagged , camera always showed errors. Battery life decreased. IQOO being a new brand , it's not very popular . Hence selling this phone would not even give you a good value. I've used this phone for less than 9 months. I regret buying this phone. I need to switch now , just because of the poor quailty and features. It showed storage is full , I cleared it out. Even after that it did not update , even after trying several times it did not seem to work. As per my reccomendation , DON'T PURCHASE THIS PHONE!"

'B07WHSR1NR','Nice product in this price range','3.0 out of 5 stars',"Product is quite good, easy to use, easy to operate, UI is masmerizing but display should be AMOLED, front camera as not as good compare to other Vivo phones, battery charging is Lil bit slow according to 18W charging, because I am already using Vivo Z1 Pro and that phone charge more faster than this phone.
