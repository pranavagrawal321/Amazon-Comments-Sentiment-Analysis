'B09BLXZX49','Very thin plastic','2.0 out of 5 stars',The cards are too lean and i cannot get any grip to hold the card in place. It is so frustrating and you can't return it.  If you are okay with sliding cards and not playing with it by holding it as tight as possible then yeah go for it.  The one cons is the packaging is good and the box that contains the card is good but the card is definitely not good.

The only disappointment is, when I purchased it was listed at Rs449/- just within few days the price got reduced to Rs382/- üòï"

'B09BLXZX49','Plastic cards are good','4.0 out of 5 stars',Cards and 4 plastic boxes which holds it are in good condition and quality is also good for the same. Recommendable. But instead of roses and other prints in the backside can be avoided and it can be something related to poker chips or card games etc. And the overall packaging from Amazon could've been better

'B09BLXZX49','My best buy from Amazon so far','5.0 out of 5 stars','Review as goes;  Pros: Quality(9/10): 1. The cards are plastic hence they wont get wet or tear easily. 2. Comes in a sturdy box. 3. Value for money.  Cons: 1. As the cards are plastic they tend to slip often though they have texture to help in grip.  Will I recommend absolutely... Good for travelling due to its compact nature and sturdy build.'

'B09BLXZX49','Dope AF','4.0 out of 5 stars',"Pros: This pretty and class cards looks too dope when u pull it out of the box.
