'B0BZ8PGTZG','Extremely soft and so cute','5.0 out of 5 stars',"Softness- It's very soft and huggable, it has a zipper behind so you can check that it's filled with soft cotton/fibre. Color: I wouldn't say it's same as shown but it's definitely better, the color shown in the original product is a bit lighter as compared to the soft toy. Look: It looks so cute in person, I bought this as a gift but definitely keeping it for myself. Value for money: Despite all the qualities, it's still a little expensive for this size."
