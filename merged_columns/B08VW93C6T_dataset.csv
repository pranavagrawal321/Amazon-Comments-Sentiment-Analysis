'B08VW93C6T','Great product only for one item (laptop with charger or notebooks/books), but not more',"'4.0 out of 5 stars'I wanted a sleek laptop cover with some additional space for notebooks or books. But there isn't space enough in this bag. I had to return it. I purchased Aircase laptop bag with double compartment, it worked for me exactly. But otherwise, this cover is nice. At a very economic price, this is the best bag anyone needs to carry only the laptop and the charger. The handle of this bag is an additional plus point which makes carrying this cover most comfortable."
