'B096P5FJVH','Go for it. Recommended','5.0 out of 5 stars',"No fuse provided. Although it's a good product. (I'm writing this review on Day 2. I'll edit this review after a month or two). Looks classic and stylish. Its a 6 socket product I purchased, I use 5 of them .. everything is working fine so far. Individual switches are great and cool. I think 10A 250V 2500W is sufficient enough to safe guard our gadgets. So you can go for it. I searched a ton for a perfect extension box with individual switch and found this one after a long research. Length is perfect as it mentioned. I bought it in Sale for Rs649."

'B096P5FJVH','Excellent but with flimsy switches','4.0 out of 5 stars','This is one of the few 3-pin extension boards available with six sockets each having individual switches. All of its six sockets are international-plugs compatible and it is very convenient to switch on/off individual plugs instead of one for all.  The only reason I took one star off is that the individual switches feel little flimsy and shaky as if they would pop off when pressing them on/off.  This product does have the brand name and sticker. The sticker however was not meant for this model but something else :-)'
