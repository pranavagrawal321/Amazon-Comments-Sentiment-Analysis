'B083PFDMC8','Worst product','1.0 out of 5 stars',"I regret buying this so much. I expected it to be good since it's biotique. First of all it is not water resistant as it claims. The liquid is too watery, the colour becomes greyish after it dries. The design of the brush is bad, a large amount comes with one dip. I bought it for the long brush but the brush is short. And IT DOESN'T REMAIN EVEN FOR 6 HOURS. I FADES!!! I guess you gotta draw really thick lines for it to stay"
