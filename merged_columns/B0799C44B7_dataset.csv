'B0799C44B7',Beat from Amazon's own home.,'5.0 out of 5 stars',"Won't 'mince' any more words and make this review lengthy. Will cut it short and keep it a one liner. It Cuts veggies like a Katana on a bamboo. Gift it to the Uma Thurman of your house. Also make sure to blunt the point of the knife on an emery paper, nail file or just on your kitchen granite (if the Boss allows you). It pokes like a needle if handled in a wrong way. Not an ordinary knife. Handle with Care or keep a Bandage in Spare. Also the one liner I promised- It's SHARP. :D"

'B0799C44B7','Good quality but not sharp enough.','3.0 out of 5 stars','Is it all about Marketing?  The way it was packed and all made the product look promising but one gentle finger check on the edges revealed how blunt they were. Although the quality of the knives feels good and sturdy but they are just not sharp enough. They couldn‚Äôt even cut onion potatoes and bread properly with precision. An iron knifes works better any day. I think a quick visit to a local shop to get it sharpened professionally could do the trick. The manufacturer must take care of its sharpness as well before selling. This is disgraceful to Solimo and Amazon‚Äôs brand name.'
