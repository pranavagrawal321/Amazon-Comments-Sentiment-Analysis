'B07SVH63PX','JBL never disappoints','5.0 out of 5 stars','The media could not be loaded. The quality of sound is amazing. U can expect no less than superior quality sound. Battery is promising as said. The charger u use is more important. Please use normal charger or not more than 33w charger battery life will reduce if we use higher than those mentioned. Even this is water-resistant please avoid using it wet. Quality mesh power socket and buttons. And please dont press the bass area with hands. Let it hop with music : )'

'B07SVH63PX','Sound Quality','4.0 out of 5 stars','It is good at 50%-60% volume bass and treble combination is too good.. But after increasing above 60% volume combination of bass and treble is not good. The Bass starts bursting.'

'B07SVH63PX','Nice and loud but no mic.','5.0 out of 5 stars','The JBL Flip 5 speaker is nice and loud with 20 watts for sound but it has no mic so you cannot speak into it with your mobile phone. If you want one with a mic then buy the JBL GO or JBL Flip 4. They both have mics. The sound on the Flip 5 is wonderful and bass is really good. If you are going only for sound it’s a great buy.'
'B07SVH63PX','BEST Speaker for around 6k','5.0 out of 5 stars','The size is perfect! And the effect is just toooo good! For this small a size the base is terrific. Portable and easy to carry. Go for it!!'
