'B08WPTFZWB','Great Aesthetics, Great Page thickness','5.0 out of 5 stars''Have re-ordered this same product probably 2-3 times now. It comes in a pack of 3 (3 notebooks).  - It looks and feels great. The brown cover is just the perfect shade of brown. gives you that wintery/autumn feeling.  - Pages are absolute white and blank (not yellowish or any other warm tint). Pure white and decently thick. Using a fountain pen on the pages doesnt leave an impression on the back side  - The spiral binding is great and sturdy  Overall a good purchase if you want a plain blank white paged notebook that looks minimal and clean'

'B08WPTFZWB','Ordered twice got the wrong order the second time','3.0 out of 5 stars','I ordered these books a couple of months ago. I liked them so much that I ordered another set last week. Unfortunately this time the books I received were not just smaller (fewer pages) but also bleached white paper not rounded edges and just all in all not at all what the product description is. I have requested for it to be replaced and will update the review.'
