'B0BV6GKK18','Really good DIY table','4.0 out of 5 stars',The media could not be loaded. Its a great table in budget.

'B0BV6GKK18','N/A','N/A','Desk looked just like the picture. It came very well packaged with heavy duty plastic corner protectors attached to each corner of the desk top and heavy duty cardboard protectors in corners of the cardboard packaging. So there was no damage to either desk (I purchased 2). Also they included one extra screw of each size which was nice in case of a problem. I just wish this desk had come in a 55”x30” size.'
'B0BV6GKK18','N/A','N/A','It’s a great sturdy desk. I love the storage on the side it’s a great add on and very confident and useful. The only thing I don’t like is there’s 2 rods on the back to help it be sturdy which I did not know and I don’t like the look it makes it look cheap but other than that it’s a great and looks great. We’ve had it for almost 2 years now and it still looks brand new.'

'B0BV6GKK18','N/A','N/A','This is the perfect size desk for an apartment. The M6 screws should have been longer as the recessed area for the screws to thread into was placed deep and therefore the screws (M6) could not get a grip on the tabletop (A). I had to go and purchase eight metric M6 - 1.0 x 50mm to make it work. However it is a beautiful desk.'
'B0BV6GKK18','N/A','N/A',"This desk is surprisingly high quality for the price. I purchased 2 of these about 2 years ago for use in my home office, and they have held up famously. The wood desktop feels sturdy and solid, it does not scratch easily nor is the finish effected by spills. I'm fairly sure that it is actual wood, and not particle board, as it is thick and heavy. It sits high enough for my legs to fit underneath and has plenty of legroom.  In fact, I like these so much, that I'm likely going to purchase 2 more here soon after a move. Highly recommend."

To return it meant that I would have to disassemble everything and repack it. Too exhausted and I needed to set up my work area. I would like a partial refund on this item.'
