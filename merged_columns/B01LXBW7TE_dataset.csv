'B01LXBW7TE','Amazing Tool box..!!','5.0 out of 5 stars','I would definitely recommend this tool box for anyone looking to get all hardware and toos organised. The top small compartments are very usefull for storing small equipments nuts and bolts. While the inside of the tool box is huge enough to accommodate any house hold tools. The material is very strudy and can support a lot of weight.'

'B01LXBW7TE','A Case Study of the Student Overtaken the Master','5.0 out of 5 stars',"Formerly Bahco (Swedish) and Taparia. One fine day they cut off Bahco and moved from strength to stenght on their own. As of few years ago, I trust Taparia more than Stanley, Black & Decker (a joke now), and win in the first round itself.  Don't know how to insert pics but I've used Clarks (very good) and now Taparia....Man, it feels solid, like a Hummer....for those who what is a Hummer...  With that solidity, it is now reserved for heavy duty stuff. It contains a Bosch Professional tile and other material requiring angle grinder. Bosch Professional Hammer cum Drill machine. Makita wood, metal and glass cutting blades, drill bits for glass and other things like wood, metal which are child's play compared to glass.  Great job Amazon and the Seller. I thought only Cloudtail could pull off this level of quality. Am thrilled next to the Taparia tool box. I sleep next to it."

'B01LXBW7TE','Delivered with a broken lock','2.0 out of 5 stars','The box is quite functional and spacious. However the piece i got had a broken locking clip. The lower rating is due to the fact that seller shipped this product knowing the clip was already broken. This is due to the fact that the previous two other customers had already returned the very same box as their old receipts were inside the box. This is quite sneaky trying to con unsuspecting customers. Amazon should crack down on such practices.'
'B01LXBW7TE','PTB22 is a spacious, sturdy but heavy and pricey. Metal clasps for locking would be better.',"'4.0 out of 5 stars'Taparia should provide metal clasps for closing the box like Stanley's Essential series of tool boxes. The plastic clasps do not elicit confidence. Pricing should be reduced and made more competitive. Otherwise, satisfied."
