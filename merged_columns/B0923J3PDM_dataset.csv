'B0923J3PDM','Gets interesting conversations going!','5.0 out of 5 stars',This is such a lovely game. The rules for playing and winning are simple and clear. The fact that some cards expect us to remember someone else's answer makes it important for people to listen to each other. Some questions are fun and superficial while some others are deep and can really lead to some deep conversations. I'm updating this review of mine since I have bought this game two more times now! I have gotten to know things about my children that I didn't before. One of the questions - what is the one thing you would like to change about your house made me think and think... about how much I love the home we have created. My 9 yo son had to talk for 30 seconds non stop describing another player and he chose his 21 yo sister! It was lovely to hear all the wonderful things he said about her! Seriously a must have game for any home! Thank you for the great game!

'B0923J3PDM','Needs like minded people','4.0 out of 5 stars',"The card game is good and there's no doubt about that. But in order to enjoy this with playmates, you definitely need some like minded and fun people who are willing to take the challanges. Otherwise, even if one player gets sulky, it's no good."
'B0923J3PDM','Lovely','5.0 out of 5 stars',This is a lovely game to play with your family and friends. The only problem I feel it with the quality of the card otherwise it is fantabulous. I would recommend to be very light with the way you touch the cards otherwise they may bend bend. Given the quality I don't think I can complain because it was worth the daily as per the monetary deal. I would highly recommend this game to every single person.
