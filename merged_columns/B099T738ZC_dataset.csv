'B099T738ZC','Easy to use anywhere','5.0 out of 5 stars','Small easy to carry and very good battery life so as to cover nearly 3 movies at a stretch. Sound is quite appealing worth buying at this price and one would not repend this buying except the situation if the product is a defective one.'
'B099T738ZC','Malfunction on bose soundlink flex','4.0 out of 5 stars',"Purchased bose soundflex from amazon on the 16th July,2023. Used it for about 2 months 1 week. A week ago, it strated to loss power and switch off by itself when the volume pass it's halfway through. Sometimes, according to the music played it turned out that, it dose'nt cope with the frequency of the sound played and starts an auto switch off. How can it be solved?"
'B099T738ZC','Faulty product.','1.0 out of 5 stars','The media could not be loaded. This does not switch on anymore. Worked well for two weeks. One did not expect this from Amazon and Bose'
'B099T738ZC','Bose is a boss.','5.0 out of 5 stars','Value for money. Good investment.'
'B099T738ZC','Good - Could have been better','4.0 out of 5 stars',"The media could not be loaded. The sound is awesome, each and every note is clear, no ambiguous tone and unnecessary crossovers. This is what I love about Bose. Soothing experience as always. Sturdy build. Smooth connectivity.  Note - Bass could have been more refined, sometimes it's just a boom. It's just 2 days that I have listened. Hindustani and carnatic classical sounds great. Pop music has this unecessary enhancement.  Need to check this. Shall update this space after few days of listening.  All in all a great sound companion!!!!"

'B099T738ZC','Gives best Value for money','5.0 out of 5 stars','Excellent sound. This speaker is good enough even for a house party( for a living room as big as 20*20 ft). It seems to be the best value for money in terms Of output and recommended for all kind of usage indoors/ outdoors.'
'B099T738ZC','High repairing cost','3.0 out of 5 stars','The problem with this brand is very few service centres in India. Repairing cost is almost 70% of price of new unit'
'B099T738ZC','All rounder with the best experience!!','5.0 out of 5 stars','Hey my brother gifted me this speaker about 10 days back and since then I’ve known sound differently. The sound at every volume is very crisp clear and detailed. It’s light weight easy to carry and decent batter life. You can pair it with two devices at a time and the transition between the two sound outputs is barely noticeable. Haven’t experimented with the water resistance aspect. Only drawback for me is its Bluetooth range which is ok for an average room but found it difficult in bigger hall and across walls. One of the best buy for my brother and ‘gift’ for me. 😛😇'

'B099T738ZC','Over rated under performer over hyped.','1.0 out of 5 stars',This Bose speaker is a mono channel and not so good sounding speaker.I also own JBL essentials@Rs 4999 which far better sounding speaker than this in lower price (minus Mic).  Sound quality doesn't justify its price.  The only purchase on Amazon which I regret.
'B099T738ZC','Quality of speaker is not good, replaced my speakers 2 times','1.0 out of 5 stars''The speakers quality is not good the speaker starts buzzing after some time this issue happens even while using the speaker with less than 60 % volume.'
'B099T738ZC','Awesome BT speaker','5.0 out of 5 stars','Audio quality vocals and bass are all good. More of an excellent personal audio device. Looking forward to mid range bluetooth speakers from Bose that can fill party hall. May be a bigger version of soundflek. Impressed overall.'

'B099T738ZC','Great speaker','4.0 out of 5 stars','I found the bass slightly less initially but then realised it was more balanced. The stereo sound when placed in the Center of the room gives a surround sound feeling. It’s got sufficient power for home and small out door use. Although it looks sleek it’s very rugged and the overall quality is great. Bose doesn’t disappoint.'

'B099T738ZC','Chhota Packet Bada Dhamaka!','5.0 out of 5 stars',"It was dream for me to own a BOSE speaker since I came to know about the brand! Luckily I ordered it on discount on prime day and I must say it was so loud at 50%! Bass is just purely outstanding, never expected a speaker this size to deliver such awesome output sound, I'm very impressed, if you're looking for bluetooth speaker for small hangout or just want to unwind after hectic work within 15k then go for Bose soundflex! It also has party mode, with 2 speakers it will rock the house! S"

'B099T738ZC','Amazing 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩','5.0 out of 5 stars',"The media could not be loaded. I have always wanted to own a bose system. Earlier I had Sony srs xb33. Undoubtedly it was good too. But despite being water proof, it malfunctioned when it was dropped in bucket of water. Disappointed I took up the chance (financially) to own 1 bose speaker. Well I guess it was the right decision. High, mids and lows everything is well balanced. Bass is good and a lot better than sony srs xb33. If you ask me about cons, as I have used a sony system, I'd say that it should have had a dedicated app for Equalizer settings and would have made more sense if someone wanted to change the audio as per their taste. Sony fulfills this gap I'd say. Another con would be that there are no flashy lights unlike Sony or JBL. Apart from these, the sound signature of bose is astounding. I am literally blown with its highs and mids and faster connectivity. If you have the budget, go for it blindly.  Edit : Another con that is mention worthy is that when I reduce the volume in my phone to less than 25%, the speaker goes mute. So basically the low handling compatibility with the connected device is bad."
'B099T738ZC','Bose can never go wrong!','5.0 out of 5 stars','I’ve been a Bose user for quite some time now. I own the QuietComfort Earbuds II Bose Smart Soundbar 900 and this one. I can guarantee you they never fail to deliver. Don’t go on the size of this speaker this bad boy sounds BIG for its size! And with what clarity! You’ll get to hear instruments and notes that you’ll never normally hear on other speakers. If you have the money just blindly go for it.'
'B099T738ZC','Bose Bluetooth speaker is a good one. I love to be the owner of this product. Thank you','5.0 out of 5 stars','Love to listen my favourite music on such a good speaker'
