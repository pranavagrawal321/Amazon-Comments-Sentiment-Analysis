'B07CJTTW7F',Don't waste your precious money on any 3.0 pen drives.,'2.0 out of 5 stars',"Don't waste your precious money on any 3.0 pen drives. (When Transfering into the Pen drive) Let me tell you the truth, for the first 10sec speed is 60-66MBps then the next 10sec it is 20-27MBps and finally 15MBps will be the only transfer speed which you will get. So the conclusion is AVERAGE SPEED= 15MBps for a expensive 3.0 pen drives and this is true for all as i have tested multiple pendrives.  (transfering from pen drive) You will get a constant speed of 150MBps no matter how hot is your Pendrive. Plastic pendrives may melt due to high temperature."

'B07CJTTW7F','Perfect....! but?','5.0 out of 5 stars','I think so many of you think its relaiable or not?. Because of just size of this drive. I just got this order. Bit confused how they created this tiny drive. Body is made up of plastic i know also it will emit little bit heat. I think drive size is small and produced excess heat will cause heats up the pendrive more than normal sized flash drives. If you are buying for home theater or car music players and any other audio product give first prefernce for this tiny machine. üòâ'
