'B0C9DDN2JB','Good laptop worth the purchase','3.0 out of 5 stars',Good laptop but got issues in adapter as well as motherboard within the first month of purchase. The HP support response is too slow. To get this repaired/ replaced I had to wait 2 months before all repairs were done. Since repairs it's working as good as it was.

'B0C9DDN2JB','Amazing Performance and Delivery, I got it within 2 days.',"'5.0 out of 5 stars'The Laptop is giving Awesome Performance. I have installed Windows 11 on the day I got this from Amazon. All the Apps are working great. Even after using heavy software like video editing or graphic designing apps, the system doesn't heat at all. No sound of the fan. Comes with MS office 2019 which is a plus point. Mcafee Antivirus comes along with it. But it's not required as windows have their own windows defender. Mcafee Makes the system slower I had to remove it. Center alignment of the Taskbar is very helpful. Gives you good performance even if you create more desktops. The only Flaw I found is Windows 11 doesn't show separated windows for the same type of files. It combines them. Which is sometimes irritating. But overall the System is amazing."
