'B07MBG2GG1','This product is of high quality and has a long lifespan.','5.0 out of 5 stars','I bought this product to organize my files and I am satisfied with it. It has 13 columns that are separated by flags. The flags are useful for labeling the columns and finding the files you need quickly. The product has a professional color and a sturdy material. The only improvement I would suggest is adding a handle on the top so you can carry it easily. It is a good product for the price.'
