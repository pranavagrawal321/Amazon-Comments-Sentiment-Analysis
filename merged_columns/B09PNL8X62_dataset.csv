'B09PNL8X62','Amazing pencil with affordable price','5.0 out of 5 stars',I am a person who usually draws an outline sketch with a mechanical pencil but my pencil is heavier I cannot draw more than 2hrs but Brustro made it easier by launching an amazing mechanical pencil.it is not very weighted and affordable as well. both leads and erasers have refills you can use for a longer period so you don't have to worry about buying new refills. While doing a pencil sketch it blends well in the sheet and about the looks it's so stylish and elegant.
'B09PNL8X62','Amazing product I love it .','5.0 out of 5 stars',"For many days I wanted a mechanical pencil and I ordered this 0.7mm pencil from Brustro which came at a decent price. I don't think there are many options which also provide two varieties of lead grades and refill erasers.  Coming to the pencil, design is good, made up of a metal case and shiny. Built quality it too good .  And here is a detail review video,And my art work ,or you can check all my artwork and art related videos in Instagram @_samar_kalakar ."
'B09PNL8X62','Best Mechanical Pencil','5.0 out of 5 stars',"The metal finish of this pencil gives it a cool royal look. It is smooth and comfy to handle. It has strong and lengthy lead which is one of the best qualities of this pencil. It comes with 2 lead options 2B and 2H, now I don't need to worry about the pencil marks. I used to avoid using the eraser in mechanical pencils, but now I don't need to worry about that too since it comes with 8 extras (+1 already attached). It works smoothly, it is budget friendly and awesome mechanism.  Overall this is the best mechanical pencil I have ever used and it is a great investment as well"

'B09PNL8X62','Value for money','5.0 out of 5 stars','Simple and usefull pencil. Perfect fitting in size with proper grip. Best product for this value. I would recommend to buy it.'
'B09PNL8X62','The best in the market. Worth every penny.','5.0 out of 5 stars',"I have tried my hands on mechanical pencils from different brands. I got these two 0.5mm and 0.7mm mechanical pencils from brustro recently and after using it here's what I think about them from my artist point of view: 1. The build is so good. It comes with a metal body that is not too heavy and the weight distribution feels perfect in hand. 2. It has 2 lead options 2B and 2H, both of those shades comes with 20 leads in two lead containers. 3. These pencils have a eraser attached at the end of the pencil, which is very handy and we get 8 extras. 4. I have used these for some times and they didn't break easily here and there, which is really good. 5. Now coming to the shading part, the leads doesn't scratch the paper, gives a smooth shading and can be blended really smooth. Also erasing them is very easy and didn't leave dark marks on the paper. 6. Getting all these features with such cool look was really rare, that too at such low price. I would say, they are totally worth the money.  However, I would really love if it had options like (hb, 2b) that we could change and after we change the hb and 2b leads and it would be easier to remember which lead is inside.  I will upload a work using these pencils within a week where you will be able to have a much better idea how these pencils work."
