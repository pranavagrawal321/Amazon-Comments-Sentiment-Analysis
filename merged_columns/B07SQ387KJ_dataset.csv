'B07SQ387KJ','Lead pushing mechanism','4.0 out of 5 stars','Only problem is with the lead system if you try to use the clicker while the pencil is downright then the lead will just fall out and if you do the same upright while putting a lead in it then it will go in the empty part at the back of pencil  then you will have to remove the eraser part and shake it to get the lead out .... In simple words the lead mechanism needs some rework'
'B07SQ387KJ','Good product','5.0 out of 5 stars','Nice! Only issue is for PPL who press hard while writing the lead slips back inside...'

'B07SQ387KJ','Really good','5.0 out of 5 stars','Uniball shalaku review: The build quality of the pencil is very good and feels premium the eraser on the back being better than most. Sturdy feel and really grippy should last at least 6-8 years before having any trouble with the components The overall life of the pack of six being 36- 42 years including the regular swapping of leads which is really long!'

'B07SQ387KJ','If you are looking for a side charging pencil, go for it.','4.0 out of 5 stars''Over the years i have used many mechanical pencils.and this 1 may be one of my favorites. I somewhy love side charging mechanical pencils and this 1s action is somewhat smoother than all the other brand mechanical pencils i own.honestly the only con i have is due to its design because its side charging the grip area of this pencil is a little bit thicker than normal pencils and i like a pens and pencils which you can grip comfortably. Its not uncomfortable or anything to use though. The pencils come with 2 leads each and the eraser in the back is not the best but usable as i said before the action is smooth and the construction feels sturdy enough for the plastic material. Over all its a good pencil for daily day to day use.'
