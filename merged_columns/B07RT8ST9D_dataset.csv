'B07RT8ST9D','Good item','5.0 out of 5 stars',The tape sticks well on tiles. I haven't tried any other surface  It doesn't seem to stick well to the NFC tags (glossy plastic) that I had used this tape to stick onto the tiles. In the pics you will see air bubbles where the tape is covering the tag. Maybe the tape is porous to air? Or maybe it is because the tape itself is slightly wrinkled (see the pic of the roll). But the tape hasn't peeled off. I haven't checked to see if the gum remains after peeling the tape off  Overall happy
