'B0BFF8Y243','Very Long Lasting and Good üòäüíØ','4.0 out of 5 stars',It's definitely long lasting and matte. U can literally wear it like good 18-24 hours. Now talking about the problem... The brush is very thick due to which cat eye look i cannot create (though i don't know how to get it perfectly). Definitely recommended for long lasting effect

'B0BFF8Y243','Bad product','1.0 out of 5 stars',Not good bad don't buy this product is harmful for your eyes very hard eyliner
'B0BFF8Y243','Quality is poor','1.0 out of 5 stars',This eyeliner is pathetic. It's give burning sensation in your eyes whenever you applied it. The brush is too thik to give precise application. Can't expect this quality from sugar

'B0BFF8Y243','Nice','4.0 out of 5 stars','I liked its look very different'
'B0BFF8Y243','Worth considering- But (Not Perfect)','4.0 out of 5 stars',"If you're looking for intense pigmentation this eyeliner delivers. The true matte finish in rich shades adds a touch of elegance to any look.  However, there were a few drawbacks. The quick-dry feature sometimes does not perform for me as I have hooded eyes. And it is challenging to correct it when it happens. Additionally, the flexible tip, while offering control, felt flimsy at times.  On the bright side, it stayed put throughout the day without smudging, perfect for busy schedules. Yet, if you're a beginner, achieving precise lines may take practice.  In conclusion, the SUGAR POP eyeliner is decent, but not without flaws. If you prioritize long-lasting wear and pigmentation, it's worth considering."
