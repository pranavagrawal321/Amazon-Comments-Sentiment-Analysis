'B08P25CGX5',"Straight up, Don't buy.",'1.0 out of 5 stars',I received this product on time but after using it for a while i noticed a few things: the table is enough sturdy that you can keep AIO pc on it but on your on risk because it wobbles alot secondly i noticed that the table has 0 finishing like i can see the mica sheet coming off. lastly the legs are weak asf like i received one with a dent (big one). I raised a complaint but still they don't care it's been almost 1 month and the amazon customer service still says your product will be picked up soon lmao. You guys really have to get better delivery agent because they aren't even performing their job properly. Hope this review helps. :')
