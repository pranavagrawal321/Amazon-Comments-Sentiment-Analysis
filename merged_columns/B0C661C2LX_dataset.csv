'B0C661C2LX','Excellent pen','5.0 out of 5 stars',"The media could not be loaded. This is a single-use fountain pen – ideal for beginners to get their practice in or people who don't want to think about cartridges. It's just so lush to write with. The ink flows so smoothly – and yet takes almost no time to dry, it's also absorbed easily without a heavy bleed"

'B0C661C2LX','Nice pens','4.0 out of 5 stars',The pens are smooth and and the nib is thin just as I like.The pen is very light to hold and you don't get any grip on it but it feels good while writing. The only problem is that it can smudge sometimes. Otherwise the performance and quality are awesome...
