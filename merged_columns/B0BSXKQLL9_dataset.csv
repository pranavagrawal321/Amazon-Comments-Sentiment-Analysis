'B0BSXKQLL9','Portable stand good one','4.0 out of 5 stars',"I bought it recently. It is a good one for daily use, but for keeping light things like, newspaper, snacks plate. My son uses for keeping dinner thali too. Size matches our sofa. Good for sick person for eating as it comes on the sofa. Colour is good. Use it & wipe it. As the stand touches hardly 2 inches area, it can't take much load."
