'B07YWNQPWM','A beautiful product for my curls','5.0 out of 5 stars',"This has been my favourite shampoo for 5 years now. Works beautifully for my curls and I absolutely love the fragrance. Some people have given poor review, not sure why. I suppose it depends on one'e skin type. I have combination skin and people with curls need more moisture in their shampoo and this shampoo provides that. Oily skin is more prone to dandruff so maybe people with oily skin could avoid this. I hope my review helps that girl or that woman who has been looking for a good curl shampoo high and low, totally worth a try. :)"
