'B07XLZ18KJ','Amazing gift item','4.0 out of 5 stars','looks good and quality is perfect'
'B07XLZ18KJ',"Waterproof, smudge proof, long-lasting, too much liquid, lid's too tight",'3.0 out of 5 stars',"I've been using this liner for 2 months now. Pros: It's water proof, smudge proof and it's definitely long-lasting. If I draw the liner in the morning it lasts till night. Cons: The lid is too tight. You have to struggle a lot before opening it. And you'll have to use a cloth or towel to open it or else your dress will be all spoiled. It's too liquidy. Whenever you open the liner some ink will be applied in your hands and if you're not cautious it'll be all over your dress too."
