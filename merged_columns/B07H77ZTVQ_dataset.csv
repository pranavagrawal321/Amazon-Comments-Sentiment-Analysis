'B07H77ZTVQ','N/A','N/A',"What I need to do the job,, was very satisfied with it. Just one thing,, the case was cracked.. but that's ok.."
'B07H77ZTVQ','N/A','N/A',"These screws are alright, good for the price. The packaging dividers were all over the place when it arrived though, so the different sized screws are all mixed up in my package. Hard to locate the screws that I need when I'm working on projects."
'B07H77ZTVQ','N/A','N/A',"I loved the price of these and they served their purpose. You'll get a black film on your hands due to its coated finish and some of these will bend on you if you're not careful but I have yet to break any and for the price, I'm ok throwing some away."

'B07H77ZTVQ','N/A','N/A',"These are a great value for how many come in the pack, just make sure you're buying the right type of screws. I ordered two sets, ended up not being what I needed, but still have found them useful."
'B07H77ZTVQ','N/A','N/A',"when I received the item, a few plastic separating plates already misplaced, and therefore the screws are not organized. it is inconvenient for finding the screws with the length I need. that's the reason for 1 less star. the screws look good and work well."

'B07H77ZTVQ','N/A','N/A',"This product came in a broken box and all of the screws were mixed up. I separated all of the screws, but it wouldn't matter because the box is so flimsy they'll get mixed up again. I ended up taping the individual sections and repairing the box."
'B07H77ZTVQ','N/A','N/A','Husband very pleased with item'
'B07H77ZTVQ','N/A','N/A',Good value for the money after spending the 45 minutes to re sort all the screws and put them back in the box where they are supposed to be. I guess that's the draw back of mail order. Is what it is. Expect it to come all jumbled together and you will have zero disappointment in this purchase.
'B07H77ZTVQ','N/A','N/A','Received the package and all of the screws for mix together as you can see in the picture the dividing slots did not seem to even be installed'

'B07H77ZTVQ','N/A','N/A',Some of the screws were bent. Everything was all mixed together. The screws leave black stains on the wood. But they are (at least) cheap. You can't take that away from em.
'B07H77ZTVQ','N/A','N/A','good selection'
'B07H77ZTVQ','N/A','N/A','Perfect!!! Great product!!üëç'
'B07H77ZTVQ','N/A','N/A','Firstly I would like to say  they are screws. Not to much to say other than the screws are meant to be departmentalized ! The dividers are out of place which allows the different size screws to get mixed together! That defeats the whole purpose of the purchase! Don‚Äôt get it!'
'B07H77ZTVQ','N/A','N/A','Container was broken on delivery screw sizes were all mixed together poor product poor delivery'
'B07H77ZTVQ','N/A','N/A','But not great'
