'B07FPSBFV1','Quality is great','4.0 out of 5 stars','The media could not be loaded. Amazing quality. Ofcrse Jockey is a big brand and this much is always expected. However its a slight tight on the thighs. Not much though. But if anyone buying this size do keep this in mind if you have bigger thighs and small waist. I took the M size and it fits perfectly on the waist as its elastic and stretchable too. So dont worry about the fitting from waist. I have attached a reference video of myself wearing it. Would be of great help for people of my height 5.10 weight 80kg and waist between 32-34. And received it on time by Amazon. The service is top notch always.'
