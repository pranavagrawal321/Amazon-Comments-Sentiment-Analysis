'B098LX956V','Makes medicine-taking simpler','5.0 out of 5 stars','The boxes come within a box; so they‚Äôre secure. The plastic may not be world-class but it‚Äôs sturdy and looks like it will last a while.  Each day is separate so when travelling it‚Äôs easier to take the medication for the days traveled instead of the whole box.  Each day has four compartments- medicines can be arranged according to requirement.  The individual boxes can fit about five big pills.  This box has really streamlined the process for me and I found it very useful.'
'B098LX956V','Absolutely Misleading Product Images!','1.0 out of 5 stars',"I was genuinely excited to receive this product, only to be utterly disappointed when I opened the package. The item inside bore little to no resemblance to the images displayed on the product's Amazon page. All the photos are grossly misleading, painting a picture of a product that you will simply not receive at the time of delivery. It's alarming that such deceptive practices are present on a platform as reputable as Amazon. This discrepancy needs to be reported to Amazon immediately to prevent other unsuspecting customers from being duped. I strongly advise against buying this product. Save your money and time."
