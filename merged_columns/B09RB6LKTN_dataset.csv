'B09RB6LKTN','Durable and leather finish belt.','4.0 out of 5 stars',"I gifted it to my father and he loved it, 1. Easy to wear. 2. Looks great in formals. 3. Easy to remove although the lever is hard to notice. 4. Say bye bye to poking holes in the belt for better fit. 5. If the length is too big for you, then there is an instruction manual for it. 6. Just the finish on this belt and touch is truly mesmerizing.  Although for me the size was small, SO DO TAKE A NOTE OF THAT. All in all it's a great belt."
'B09RB6LKTN','Nice','3.0 out of 5 stars',The buckle quality is not up to the mark. It's too light in weight. Lock gets stuck while opening belt. Rest product is good.
