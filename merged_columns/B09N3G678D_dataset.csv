'B09N3G678D',"Very poor and bad quality , couldn't handle the basic impact for 3 months .",'1.0 out of 5 stars','Not gonna recommend to anyone  broke after 3 months of using.'
'B09N3G678D','Good but not that great.','3.0 out of 5 stars',"First of all go one size bigger. I use 8uk shoes so I went for 9UK for flip flops. Now those reviewers who likes it and are saying it's soft, I wonder what they used to wear before. Maybe someone made of rock. It's anything but cloudfoam. Comming from the Adidas eezay flip flops (mrp1999), this is not satisfactory. Just 200 RS short and a huge difference in quality. These are however less slippery as compared to Adidas eezay but rest is not on par. The print will surely wear off quickly. Have experienced many Adidas flip flops and these are definitely not the better ones. I recommend not to buy it. It's not really cloud foam go for eezay instead. If there is a high price gap, consider something else. The eezay feels like cloud foam and this feels more like orthoheavy (not even ortholite)"

'B09N3G678D','Only looks good.','2.0 out of 5 stars',"They only look good. You expect good quality from Adidas, but not from this item. Bought these chappal in late May, they broke today (27th August). The strap came out from the side.  1k for a pair of slippers, and they can't even last 3 months? Maybe they're fake or something, because they didn't come in a box. I don't even run in these, just walk they still gave out. üòÇ  I'd personally not recommend this product. You're better off buying a pair of slippers from your local market."
'B09N3G678D','Not good','1.0 out of 5 stars','Only purchase it for outer wear or around the house. Do not purchase this slippers if you use it for bathroom as you‚Äôll feel like you‚Äôre walking on ice. It is very very slippery. Plus not that comfortable for regular use as my feet started to ache the very next of wearing for a very short while to see how it feels. Would not recommend this product.'
