'B07S9KQSKZ','The material could be better at this price point','3.0 out of 5 stars','The media could not be loaded. Could be better at this price point. the feathers are damaged.

'B07S9KQSKZ','Worst feather shuttle cock.','1.0 out of 5 stars','It has very unpredictable flight trajectory. Sometimes it travels and sometime it doesn’t. You can hit it with a lot of force and it won’t go far. Also net play is impossible. This is probably meant for kids for recreational activity'
