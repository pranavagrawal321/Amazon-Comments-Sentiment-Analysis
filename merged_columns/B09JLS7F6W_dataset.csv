'B09JLS7F6W','Too tight','1.0 out of 5 stars','I had ordered first time size L and it came to be tight... so I exchanged it for XXL thinking may be their size chart is off but the XXL one also is as tight as before. There is no size printed on the item. It seems they only have one size and delivers it irrespective of what size customer is placing.'
'B09JLS7F6W','Good value for money, drapes beautifully','4.0 out of 5 stars''This is the skirt to go for if you‚Äôre on the heavier side especially if you have a tummy as the pleats easily hide it. The waist band is elastic and very comfortable. Will have to see how durable it is. The fit and flow of the skirt is lovely and if you were stockings with it you‚Äôre all set for even cold weather. Happy with my purchase overall.'

'B09JLS7F6W','Good at cheap price','4.0 out of 5 stars','If you are looking for a great product in pleated skirt put 1600Rs which other site selling. For this price I m okay. I ordered XXL.'
'B09JLS7F6W','Not suitable for wearing outside','1.0 out of 5 stars',"The material is very cheap but for the price point no complaints about that. The pleats are not well defined and are sparse. So you wouldn't get what you would get in a 1000 rs skirt. But that's understandable too. What I don't get is that I bought the largest even though my size is smaller than that. Just wanted to make sure I got the correct size. Well the skirt was extremely small. Like I can fit my head in it. So for fall girls or curvy girls, don't go for it...."

'B09JLS7F6W','Wrong size sent','2.0 out of 5 stars',I ordered a XXL but I received an M because of which the skirt wasn't that flowy and was body clinging. If I wanted a pencil skirt I would've ordered so! Also the length I felt was a little short. When worn at the waist it was in the upper-mid calf. Skirts look better at the bottom-mid calf.
