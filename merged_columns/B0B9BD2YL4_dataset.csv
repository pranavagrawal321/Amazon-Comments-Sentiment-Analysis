'B0B9BD2YL4','Does what it claims','4.0 out of 5 stars',"Here is my initial impression of this product. I have an ipad mini 6th gen, so this got paired without any issues and I was able to create doodle and write notes without any issues.  I do have a tampered glass applied on ipad still no issues using this. This one charges wirelessly like apple pencil 2 which is good thing and good thing is that no more extra wires.  The drawing experience may not be like pencil 2 but if you are on budget and don't do serious drawing then this is more than enough for you."

'B0B9BD2YL4','Best apple pencil alternative at genuine price.','5.0 out of 5 stars','The media could not be loaded. Kingone wireless charging pencil is the best alternative i found so far for apple pencil gen 2. It seamlessly charged with the wireless charging dock on i pad I use it with my i pad air 5gen and found it really great. The pressable button on the top of back is so much helpful as if you want to quickly move into recent apps or close an app or to. Take a screen shot with triple click all of it is seamless. I also found out you can turn on screen with pressing the button‚úåüèº No problem of discharge seen.absolutely great battery life.
