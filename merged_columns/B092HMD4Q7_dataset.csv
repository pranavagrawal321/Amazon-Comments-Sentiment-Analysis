'B092HMD4Q7','Worth it','4.0 out of 5 stars',"The earphones are really bang for the buck, as the sound quality is very clear although there's no good bass. When you connect to laptop audio jack, you can notice that the volume level set for your previous ear phone will be too high for this and need to reduce by 50% :) Only 15-20% vol is equal to 70% levels of desi brands. Just go for it"
