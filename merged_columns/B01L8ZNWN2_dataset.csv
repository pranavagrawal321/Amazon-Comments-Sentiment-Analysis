'B01L8ZNWN2','About HP v236w USB 2.0 64GB Pen Drive, Metal, Silver''4.0 out of 5 stars''Good Quality metal Pendrive with storage capacity showing around 57GB. The pendrive is more durable than a plastic body pendrive due to its strong metal body. Data transfer speed is around 7 to 10 Mbps in general sometimes showing up to 20 Mbps it also depends upon the PC speed. Overall is good.'
