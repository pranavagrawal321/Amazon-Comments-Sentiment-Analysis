'B08CS9NC8Y','Rubbish suitcase at high cost','1.0 out of 5 stars','The suitcase zip came open in the middle when passing through hand luggage security twice. We had to tape the suitcase shut. This was one week after a purchase. It was very difficult to lodge a complaint i finally contacted delsey usa. We were asked to take the suitcase to the nearby store. At the store they told us we should not have purchased a single zip suitcase (!) and that it comes open and we must have prised it open with a pen - mid-journey with the bag on security belt!!!! I have left the suitcase at the store - not clear what the outcome will be. It is practically 3 times the cost of a safari suitcase but has performed poorly - my safari and American tourister suitcases have travelled with me for so many years without a problem. This is simply unacceptable for a company that promises international warranty and replacement for damage within 30 days! We are well within a month after purchase. Very very disappointed and 6000 rupees poorer.'
