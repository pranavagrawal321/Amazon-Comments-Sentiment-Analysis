'B001PNHWFC','Serves the purpose if you look beyond durability','4.0 out of 5 stars','This trivet is light weight and does not seem so durable. Need to use it for months to see if it is a good purchase. Saying that it does serve its intended purpose. Saves the wooden table from hot utensils. Or avoids expensive utensils from scratches while setting on hard surfaces. It does take stains from a hot utensil. For Rs.600 (6 pieces 2 sets 3 in a set) not too bad a deal.'
