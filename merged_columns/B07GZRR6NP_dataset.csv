'B07GZRR6NP','Great sound base','5.0 out of 5 stars','I like the quality of sound  Good durability'
'B07GZRR6NP','Impressive to Start with...But Fails Over time','2.0 out of 5 stars',"'So I had bought this as a birthday gift for a senior family member. It sounded really good in the beginning. Was handled with utmost care as well - so no mistake from this side. However one fine day all of a sudden it just stopped playing songs. The battery was recharged and still - nothing. Finally I took it to a repair shop and was told that the stuff driving the program is busted. VERY disappointing News indeed. So I would have to send it back to the company for repairs and spend more cash on it than I had paid while buying it.  So I did the next best thing. Since THANKFULLY - everything else seemed to be working fine I copied my own collection of songs on a USB Drive and the original owner is using it to hear songs from the USB drive now. Long may it last.  Personally I wouldn\'t recommend this product. Using those prerecorded songs as bait this company fails to deliver a sturdy product. The Unit I bought stopped playing the prerecorded songs within the first 3 months! More or less a disservice to the Legends they are basing their product on. I am aware that it is the lowest end model of SaReGaMa. But that doesn\'t mean it has the license to be shoddy.  Turns out SaReGaMa is doing a ""BoloTataTata"" (apologies to Daler Mehndi) to your cash with this product. Better avoided.'"
