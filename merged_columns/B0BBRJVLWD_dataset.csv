'B0BBRJVLWD','6 Month Product Life- Warranty is a joke','3.0 out of 5 stars','I am writing this review after trying atleast 3-4 products from Portronics brand and all of them were mobile accessories. Now one thing which was Portronics has managed to do well is - the product life.  All of these products ( that include charge charging cable fast charger and keyboard) died exactly after 6 months. So the shelf life of any accessories you purchase is just about 6 months. This is okay for products like charging cable( since they are anyways cheap alternatives to the High-quality brand).  But specially this charger comes with a warranty of 1 year. So I thought to claim the warranty and I was being told that I need to ship the product (to and fro) on my expense and they will send me a the same product after repairing it instead of a replacement. Plus they dont entertain walk in to their support center.  So after knowing all these fact if you are okay then go ahead and purchase it If not then simply go for other brands with much better shelf life of their products.'
'B0BBRJVLWD','Excellent product.','5.0 out of 5 stars','Liked the both usb b and c type points and nothing to complain.'
