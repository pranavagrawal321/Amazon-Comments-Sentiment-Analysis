'B0BGH4PH8M','Looks small but totally power packed','5.0 out of 5 stars',"At first I was skeptical as size and thickness didn't coerce with the heavy bleeding level on the package.

'B0BGH4PH8M','Soft cotton pads','5.0 out of 5 stars','These pads will take you back to the late 90s when soft cotton pads were a thing. Unlike the latest ones which are ultra thin and flat Bella napkins give you that soft cushioning. At the time of disposing you can remove the soiled cotton and flush it. The outer plastic can be disposed into the dry waste bin. No itchy feel no second guessing no leakage nor rash. I highly recommend this. I bought this pack out of curiosity and looking at the price point value for money. Pleasantly surprised as it ticks all the boxes. Ladies give these a try.'
'B0BGH4PH8M','Very high absorption','5.0 out of 5 stars','Product is very good and absorption is very high  it met my expectations and used Bella Pantyliners and both napkins a and pantyliners are very soft and good for skin.'
