'B006QAXPFK','N/A','N/A',"'I bought a single Nataraj pencil from CWPencils (it was not called ""bold""; it was just a regular ""ruby"") and it is actually darker than these so-called ""bold"" pencils. They\'re not bad mind you. They just aren\'t particularly bold and dark as the box would suggest. Nice eraser and plastic sharpener though. :-)'"
