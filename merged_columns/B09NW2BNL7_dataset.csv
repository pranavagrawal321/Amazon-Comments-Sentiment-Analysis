'B09NW2BNL7','Never disappoints','5.0 out of 5 stars',"This brand has been standing tall against its competitors n for all the good reasons. My skin is sensetive n even with reputed n well established brands, have experienced rashes after one time uaage. However, that's not the case for the brand. Mild, strong (barring one or two), you pick any option n it's hassle-free experience. Though the fragnence doesn't stay for ages as depicted however, it has longivity for few hours. End of the day, it's a deodrant n can't ask more outta it."
