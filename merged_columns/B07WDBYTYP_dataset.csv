'B07WDBYTYP','SuperThins (and not pure cotton)','1.0 out of 5 stars',"'These are super thin: so good when you really don\'t want much on your feet.  But they don\'t feel like cotton more like acrylic: and the Elastic at the knee/shin don\'t look like they\'ll last.  Buy if you really want ""thin"" socks but don\'t want the ankle-lenth versions.'"
