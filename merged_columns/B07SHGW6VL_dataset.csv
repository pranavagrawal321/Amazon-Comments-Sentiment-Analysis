'B07SHGW6VL','Good transfer speeds, but gets really hot',"'4.0 out of 5 stars'Sequential read speeds are as advertised, write speeds are also decent. The price is a bit on the higher side (got it for Rs. 629), but the main downside is that the aluminium body gets really hot really quickly, to the point where you can't hold it for more than 3-4 seconds. Apparently the drive itself doesn't get damaged according to other forums, but I'm more worried about the USB port on my PC."

'B07SHGW6VL','Very heat','1.0 out of 5 stars',Very heat and only 13 Mbps data transfer. Kindly don't foolish to customer. I can't touch pendrive after 5 minutes of data transfer.
'B07SHGW6VL','Not as lightning fast as it claims.','4.0 out of 5 stars',"The flash drive looks elegant in its silver coloured pure metallic body. It doesn't get recognised by every USB port that I put it into. The tranfer speed is okay, not as lightning fast as it claims to be. You get 116 GB usable space.  Overall, a good but not a great product."
