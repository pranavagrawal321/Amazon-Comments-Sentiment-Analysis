'B076BML23T','A must buy','5.0 out of 5 stars',This is my 3rd time purchase. It is a quilt-cum-comforter. Can be used in all season. Very soft & light weight. Easily foldable & doesn't take much space on the bed. I have been using it since last 2years and i am very satisfied with the product.

'B076BML23T','Worth every penny - Super Comfy','5.0 out of 5 stars',"The media could not be loaded. Product I received was exactly as shown in the picture. It was prettier in real. The packaging was impressive. The quality of the comforter is incredible. Its got a delicate, cottony touch which I loved the most. The material is dense as it says 200 GSM, the higher the number of GSM, the denser the cloth is. Initially, I was skeptical to buy this product as there were mixed reviews about it, but I thought to give it a try. And I am loving it. The only drawback is, its a little crumpled. But an iron is always at rescue. I will iron it lightly. Otherwise, trust me it is a saviour, as I am a person who loves to set the AC to 17 degree all night. It has definitely solved my purpose. Worth every penny!!! Go ahead and buy it, and you'll know it!! Thanks Amazon <3"

'B076BML23T','First look and feel','4.0 out of 5 stars','The media could not be loaded. The packaging was good but it was a little torn from the top corner of the box but the product was fine inside. When I opened the plastic wrap… The first impression was great it’s look and feel is great worth the money at this price point…but when I started unfolding it I saw dirt and dust on the comforter l it was not clean… so I checked the whole comforter to see if there’s any blotch or pockmark on it but other than dirt and dust there was nothing. SO THE FINAL REVIEW IS go for this brand Solimo and this product if your budget is low and you want that luxury feel and comfort.'
'B076BML23T','Poor Comforter doesn’t helps the purpose','1.0 out of 5 stars','The media could not be loaded. Writing this review after using it for an year. The quality is very poor since the beginning and the stuffing is poor and heavy material which breaks down after min use and gets very heavy at places and very light at parts with uneven stuffing. It’s stitching also comes off despite mild use and dry clean only. Overall a bad quality product thank you Solimo Thank you Amazon'
'B076BML23T','Great product overall','5.0 out of 5 stars','Very soft good material attractive color. Fully recommended.'
'B076BML23T','Good product but received different color','4.0 out of 5 stars','Product is good but I received a different color than what I had selected for my order. … .. .'
'B076BML23T','Product feels cheap and lacks proper finishing.','3.0 out of 5 stars',"The product was okay overall. Product delivered to me had issues with the stitching on all the side, Infact it was missing the stitching on 3 sides. I found many other buyers who had same issue. I could see that this lack of stitching had caused the fabric to get easily damaged from sides in few reviews. Thus I ordered an replacement. Hoping the replaced one doesn't have the same issue.  Other than that, the feeling is all polyester and it doesn't feel warm. If you get it for around 700 800 then it is justified, otherwise overpriced."
