'B07JCSJ93N',It's a oKish product,'3.0 out of 5 stars',Material : Padded inside and outer simply cotton. Durability : It's thin and it's a okayish product . Conclusion : If you are looking for heavy padded sleeve that can protect your laptop from weight and all then it's not the product you are searching for. If you want a cover for office laptop and to put charger with it and carry it in your backpack then it is the product. Else okish product.
'B07JCSJ93N','Excellent quality for what we paid.','5.0 out of 5 stars',The quality of the material is really superb. But no idea about how long the zip and runner will be good. Water resistant is really superb while getting delivery it's a heavy rainfall in my area. I just unpack and showed it directly to the rain for 10 seconds and checked the bag not even a single drop inside the bag. So hopefully it will protect our laptop against unexpected water spills.
