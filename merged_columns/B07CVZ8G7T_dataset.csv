'B07CVZ8G7T',Don't buy. The adhesive from the label ruins the look of the bottles,'2.0 out of 5 stars',"The bottles are fine and expensive too. However, the a reputed company lime Milton has used cheap labels with strong adhesive and removing these have been a nightmare even after soaking the bottles in soapy hot water and then scrubbing it off with non-stick scrubbers. Without using the scrubbers hard it was not possible to remove the labels. And this has completely ruined the appearance of the bottle and also has removed the logo too even before its very first use. Extremely disappointing! Buy steel bottles from other companies that use proper labels that come off easily and do not use cheap labels with strong glue on otherwise expensive bottles. I wish I didn't buy these!"
