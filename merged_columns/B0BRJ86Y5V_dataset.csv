'B0BRJ86Y5V','Charger cannot be carried','2.0 out of 5 stars',"Sleeves are literally small that adaptor cannot fit when there's laptop inside. I thought it could at least accommodate the charger along with laptop but it disappointed me.  Go for it, if you want to carry only a Laptop & slimmest devices like cables, memory cards, pen drives etc., Material quality is good and looks like water repellent too."
'B0BRJ86Y5V','It has no cushion at the base.','2.0 out of 5 stars','The very essence of this product is to protect the laptop. The bag has no cushion or strap at the base to protect it. Such a grave mistake. The laptop rests in the space but has no padding to protect it. You need to relook into your design.'

'B0BRJ86Y5V','Not A worth Product, waste of money','3.0 out of 5 stars''It is not at all a water-resistant bag. Water comes inside when it rains.'
'B0BRJ86Y5V',I don't like the material,'3.0 out of 5 stars',"I think it's good enough for the price and comes with loads of pockets for extra accessories. I didn't really love the material. Not very luxurious to touch, bit rough, but it might be water proof which is very good. If functionality is important to you, go for this. If you want style, sleekness and compactness, I'd recommend the amazon brand one or one of the other slightly more expensive ones."

Not only does it provide great padding protection for the laptop(hp pavilion 15) but the two extra pockets in front can also accommodate the charger and other things like keys,pens etc. The zipper works very well and it is a perfect fit for the laptop. I brought the blue variant and its great. Weight of the bag is same as the laptop weight."
