'B07SM8DM88','Disappointed','2.0 out of 5 stars','Not as expected.it got dried very soon. Not soo pigmented.average product.'
'B07SM8DM88','Very bad product never seen an eyeliner like this it smudge all over my eyes','1.0 out of 5 stars','Horrible eyeliner it ruined my makeup after applying eyeliner it smuged all over my eyes'
'B07SM8DM88','No good','2.0 out of 5 stars',"The product claimed to be smudge-proof, but in reality, it smudged all over my eyes, making it quite frustrating to use. I wouldn't recommend it."
'B07SM8DM88','Poor quality','1.0 out of 5 stars',It doesn't even stay for 2 hours and smudges on all over your face. What waterproof?? Smudges even without water. And will stick to your eyes even on the lower part where you put kajal. It took me two days to remove it completely from under eye. Even after using make up remover.Do not buy. Instead go for the liquid one for Swiss beauty. That's better.
'B07SM8DM88','Good','5.0 out of 5 stars','Good'
'B07SM8DM88','Colour and dryness','3.0 out of 5 stars',"Colour is okay but it's a little fade. And it's getting dry very soon. Like within a month after buying. When I purchased it first, it was good. But later from the second product, I have to face these issues."

'B07SM8DM88','Mixed feelings','3.0 out of 5 stars',"The media could not be loaded. While the applicator and colour is really good, it is as slow drying as a liquid liner and kinda shiney. It's not smudge proof and definitely not waterproof. Feels kinda unreasonable for the formula to not be waterproof and smudge proof in this day and age ."
'B07SM8DM88',It's good,'4.0 out of 5 stars',"One thing I love about this is that it's smudge proof. It's easy to apply... and has lasted for a year now and still have no problem in applying. It's worth it. But one disadvantage is that it washes off too quickly. Doesn't smudge, but washes off like dry powder. But I like it."
'B07SM8DM88','Totally waste of money','1.0 out of 5 stars',It's like a sketch pen and not water proof even easily to remove by your finger.

'B07SM8DM88','Donâ€™t buy this','1.0 out of 5 stars','After applying the product the eyes get swelled'
'B07SM8DM88','Its ok','3.0 out of 5 stars','I bought it after hearing so many beauty influencers rave about it. But its ok has a slight plastic shine. However the tip us actually super fine as compared to maybelline or loreal pen liners'
'B07SM8DM88','Worst product','1.0 out of 5 stars',It's not at all waterproof....worst product even....better was dazzler eyeliner which Yu get for 30 rs.....such a waste of money...I think I can use it as sketch pen or marker.....never even buy this product.... within 10 mins I realized that my eyes turned to smoky eyes with smudging all over my eye lid....

'B07SM8DM88','Not very good just fine','3.0 out of 5 stars',I like the product but it is not worth the money. It is not waterproof and smudge proof. It is like a regular eyeliner which can get off with some sweat. You don't need to wash it even.

'B07SM8DM88','Super Good, Go for it!','5.0 out of 5 stars''I just loved the product. It has very thin tip which makes it very easy for application and also will give you a perfect winged eye. The liquid is waterproof. When you wash it it will just peel off. It is smudge proof as well. I have tried multiple pen eyeliners and I guess among those this is the best one which I have used.'
