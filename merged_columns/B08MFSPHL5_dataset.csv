'B08MFSPHL5','Just what I wanted, exactly what I was looking for',"'5.0 out of 5 stars'I wanted a sleek, metal, matte black bottle, which also works as a flask, this bottle is both, and more.  It comes with three lids as advertised, I primarily use the lid with the spout as seen in the picture, all the lids and the bottle are good quality, feels a bit premium even.  I can't think of a single problem with this bottle so far, at this price point of 1200 I'd say I'm getting exactly what I paid for and more, hence it deserves 5 stars."

'B08MFSPHL5','Good Quality','5.0 out of 5 stars','Its good quality with three different caps for ur convenience.'
'B08MFSPHL5','Suprb','5.0 out of 5 stars',"It's suprb ,kindly go for it üòçüòò"
'B08MFSPHL5','Functioning well','5.0 out of 5 stars','Really the look is unique and easy to handle.'
'B08MFSPHL5','Excellent Product','5.0 out of 5 stars','The bottle is very nice for people who wanna carry it out and has multiple lid options which make it very comfortable to use same for multiple purposes'
'B08MFSPHL5','N/A','N/A','I love ice cold water and wow this bottle works so amazing. I put about 20oz of ice witg my water in it and used it at my job I work in an office so the temp is 70f after 12 hours there was still ice in there with the water. I love this water bottle.'
'B08MFSPHL5','N/A','N/A','Water turns warm similar to my shaker bottle ice lasts a bit longer but nothing special. Returned.'
'B08MFSPHL5','N/A','N/A','Hold ice 24+ hours. Bought this for my kiddo shocked at the great quality and price! 5 stars!'
'B08MFSPHL5','N/A','N/A',"Made myself coffee to have by my bed. It kept it hot all night even down to the last mouthful next morning. A choice of lids which is a great idea which means it can be used as a conventional flask,a travel beaker or a self contained straw which is my personal favourite and once the straw is back in its flat position can turn it upside down and give it a good shake without any leaks whatsoever. Very stable base only drawback is it won't fit the built in cup holder. Highly recommend this insulated bottle."
'B08MFSPHL5','N/A','N/A','it was too heavy for me.'
'B08MFSPHL5','N/A','N/A',"'The bottle is very sturdy and the caps are well made. I use it for soccer practice and general use. It has taken a few accidental hits from the ball and gas held up pretty well against it. I have been very satisfied with it so far however I did not receive my ""flip-up"" cap with package which is the reason why I took away 1 star. If you could send my the cap I would be happy to change it to 5 stars :).'"
'B08MFSPHL5','N/A','N/A','items look great'
'B08MFSPHL5','N/A','N/A','Bottle is way too big and leaks! Would like to change it'
'B08MFSPHL5','N/A','N/A','We love how cold the water stays but I bought three of these and the top leaks on all three. Ugh.'
'B08MFSPHL5','N/A','N/A','A good size and the three lids a bonus and useful.'
'B08MFSPHL5','N/A','N/A','Keeps my water cold for a long time. Seals well and is comfortable to carry'
'B08MFSPHL5','N/A','N/A','Keeps water cold a long time. Ice does melt fast .'
'B08MFSPHL5','N/A','N/A','This water bottle is worthless! It leaks everywhere and the rubber mouth piece comes off in my child‚Äôs mouth I bought 3 and wasted all my money!!!!'
'B08MFSPHL5','N/A','N/A','My daughter loves this water bottle! She takes it everywhere with her. She‚Äôs dropped it numerous times and there‚Äôs only a few smaller dents so pretty happy with that. It keeps her water nice and cold and is larger than her other water bottles so that she doesn‚Äôt have to fill it so often but not too big for her to handle. The problem is we‚Äôve only had this for 2 months and the silicone spout is cracking and making it so that she can‚Äôt get very much water to come out when she sucks on it. Other than that we love this water bottle.'
'B08MFSPHL5','N/A','N/A','Brought this for my brothers birthday and the colour and quality is great! Variety of lids to pick from and can use both hot and cold'
'B08MFSPHL5','N/A','N/A',"Sturdy and a good size. I like that it comes with multiple lids as well.  I've used it for both hot and cold drinks and it does very well at maintaining temperature. Chilled water will stay chilled for a good couple of hours, and a hot drink will take at least 2 or 3 hours to get cold.  Very very good."
'B08MFSPHL5','N/A','N/A','I was surprised by the variety of tops that came with the bottle. It works and is good colors match too the pictures'
'B08MFSPHL5','N/A','N/A','When you drink the straw has air going in it so your drink is not a solid stream. I use it everyday but wouldn‚Äôt order it again'
'B08MFSPHL5','N/A','N/A','Great for hot drinks and also cold drinks when driving. However water didn‚Äôt seem to stay hot for very long.'
'B08MFSPHL5','N/A','N/A',"This water bottle literally keeps the water cold or hot for a very long time. (over 24 hours) Its as light as feather, and easy to carry around even when its filled with 64 ounces of water. This lil gen right here has made drinking water fun again, and I say this because I'm not a big fan of drinking water. This was the main reason I bought this water bottle...to help me start back drinking the required 64 oz a day. This bottle keeps the water so icy cool that I've been drinking the full 64 oz of water with no problems. I love it."
'B08MFSPHL5','N/A','N/A','Do not buy this if you are looking for leakproof. All of the lids leak. It fell over in my daughters backpack and now her folder and one of her books is ruined. The backpack had to go in the dryer because it‚Äôs sopping wet. Don‚Äôt buy this product if you are specifically looking for leak proof.'
'B08MFSPHL5','N/A','N/A',"Great product. The heck with biking or hiking. I just use them in the home. Keeps things cold or hot for a long time. For things that are carbonated, it keeps the gas in longer. If you bring it to your bedroom to watch the tube at night not only does it keep stuff cold as the fridge for you but you also don't have to worry about spilling it especially for people like me who has epilepsy and would not only spill glasses, I would smash them with my face and head so these are safer"
'B08MFSPHL5','N/A','N/A','Learn from my mistake and just spend the money on a good name brand water bottle. This one immediately dented and chipped.'
'B08MFSPHL5','N/A','N/A','Keeps my water cold and it is easy to clean for me. I used to use my brita bottle but since I am gaming for a decent amount of time at night my water warms up in that bottle but I haven‚Äôt had to worry about that with this bottle'
'B08MFSPHL5','N/A','N/A',"Keeps ice for hours. The different lids are so convenient. Doesn't leak!! I have the 64oz and it lasts me all day long, water stays ice cold. I'm very surprised on how well this bottle holds up! Buy it!!"
'B08MFSPHL5','N/A','N/A','I use this on my night stand to keep water for meds and normal drinking. it keeps the water nice and cold for quite a while. and the straw spout is great for not having to fully sit up at night (my dogs take over any space i leave when i move at night lol) so i can drink my water and keep my sliver of the bed!  The colors are great i havent had them scratch off and ive dropped this bottle a few times. no dents yet either but all the drops have been under 3 ft. I without meaning to ended up matching my coffee tumbler i use in the mornings (the bottom purple is extreamly close to the cups purple)'
'B08MFSPHL5','N/A','N/A',"I bought one over a year ago, and LOVE it. I use it for my ice tea. I absolutely have had no problems whatsoever with it which is why I wanted another one. For about three months, maybe longer, I had bookmarked it hoping to have the money to buy it. Finally, finally, I ordered it and it arrived yesterday. I washed it and used it last night and tried again this morning. Both times the drinking straw lid and/or straw doesn't work, and that's the sole reason I bought it. Out of the three lids provided, this is the one I use. I guess I'm going to have to return it. So disappointed that I waited so long, and now I can't use it. Maybe it's just a fluke since the first one I got last year works so well."
'B08MFSPHL5','N/A','N/A',"First of all, I love this color and the price was great! I drink a ton of water and this half gallon size is a nice companion to my 40 oz tumbler. This thermos has been dropped several times already in U-Haul trucks and aside from some scuffs, it still seals the water well and insulates well. The cap hasn't broken either.  I appreciate this durable, high quality thermos."
'B08MFSPHL5','N/A','N/A',"The media could not be loaded. Once again, my hunt for a reasonably priced water bottle that doesn't leak has been a total fail :( Had high hopes for this guy! It's cute and feels durable, but is 100% NOT leak proof. Really need a flip cap or straw water bottle I can put it in the same bag as my computer and not have to worry about it leaking everywhere. This was not that. Guess my quest continues. Booooo."
'B08MFSPHL5','N/A','N/A','It keeps the water cold'
'B08MFSPHL5','N/A','N/A','The quality appears great at first. It takes knocks well to the stainless steel section the lid is another story. We are less than 5 weeks into year 3 and the straw kid has already cracked and it has (in contrast to their advertising claims) begun to leak. Not just any leak it‚Äôs now pouring out unless upright. The other thing is I can‚Äôt find replacement parts. It‚Äôs not ideal to use the clip lid or the twist too options in school so the straw is the best option.  The positive about the bottle is that it really does keep the drinks colder for much longer than many similar bottles of this price point.  Will I buy it again unlikely but that‚Äôs not to say initially we weren‚Äôt impressed just disappointed now that it‚Äôs broken so soon and can‚Äôt find replacement parts.'
'B08MFSPHL5','N/A','N/A','It keeps my drinks cold for about 24h! Great for midnight water crisis. üíß'
'B08MFSPHL5','N/A','N/A','This product was absolutely amazing at keeping drinks cold then after a year it‚Äôs just ok. Not too sure why as the seal is still good in all the lids? Just an ok for me.'
'B08MFSPHL5','N/A','N/A','It‚Äôs a great bottle and keeps everything hot and/or cold. The only thing that I don‚Äôt like about it is the straw. After using it about 6-8 times the straw has already broke in both bottles. Both bottles have only been washed by hand as we didn‚Äôt want to take a chance in the dish washer. I would be happy to buy some extra straws but I don‚Äôt know where to get them.'
'B08MFSPHL5','N/A','N/A','After only a few weeks use this leaks'
'B08MFSPHL5','N/A','N/A','I like that this does stay hot/cold for a day. Has different tops for different uses. Cleans up well and is very sturdy. Perfect.'
'B08MFSPHL5','N/A','N/A','I would give it zero stars if I could.Very disappointed. My bottle was very clearly used and damaged. Completely unacceptable that this was sold as a new products. The bottom was dented and missing the color coating scratches and even water on the inside of the bottle. I don‚Äôt recommend buying this.'
'B08MFSPHL5','N/A','N/A','Buen producto hasta ahora he probado que las bebidas se mantienes frias por mucho tiempo aunque no he pasado de 6h pero considerando otros productos es bastante tiempo.'
'B08MFSPHL5','N/A','N/A','Le bouchon avec la paille ne ferme pas bien sur une de deux bouteilles demande fait par courriel il y a 2 semaines toujours pas de r√©ponse : ('
'B08MFSPHL5','N/A','N/A','I like the choices I have. It is a great cup'
'B08MFSPHL5','N/A','N/A','Keeps your drink ice cold! Filled half way up with ice on Monday and had ice cubes 3 days later. Much better than Yeti brand. 3 different are convenient as well'
'B08MFSPHL5','N/A','N/A',"Three great tops, keeps drinks cold overnight (use full ice cubes) and strong.  My son has one of these that I got him to show him how rubbish the air up units are.  At this stage it looks like something that stopped a few bullets in WW1, but every dent would have been a smashed plastic bottle.  He still brings the air up bottle out , but when it's hot out or its sports this is the bottle he selects himself as an ice cold drink beats a whiff of watermelon and warm water every time. I bought my wife and I one afterwards."
'B08MFSPHL5','N/A','N/A','It fits in the cup holder in my car (barely) which is nice. It seems sturdy. The colors are pretty. I also like having three different choices for the lid. I like the straw one the best but I tend to alternate between the straw lid and the flip-top lid. I put the lids in the dishwasher and handwash the bottle itself.'
