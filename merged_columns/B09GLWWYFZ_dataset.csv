'B09GLWWYFZ','Designed nicely, but with poor stich n wool / fabric üëé',"'3.0 out of 5 stars'In short - Very rough fabric, Itching everywhere ! üòïüëé  I liked the design, long suit like cardigan , so ordered pink color. Which was small sized so asked for replacement. Xl rcvd with great color (Rani- I'll upload those images afterwards) (both the colors were awesome) Length was also good, upto knee in Xl. But....  However, after started using within 10 mins, it started giving irritation n itching. I couldn't wore it more than 20 mins.  ‡§¶‡§ø‡§ñ‡§®‡•á ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§¨‡§π‡•Å‡§§ ‡§™‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§∞‡§æ ‡§π‡•à, ‡§≤‡•á‡§ï‡§ø‡§® ‡§™‡§π‡§®‡§®‡•á ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§π‡§æ‡§≤‡§§ ‡§ñ‡§∞‡§æ‡§¨ !  Not comfortable at all.  So finally asked for return.  Also the stiches which are joining the different parts are coming out, even of the button holes. Don't know what will happen after washing it.  Cost was Rs.758!!! Not worthy at all. Won't recommend as it's waste of time n money. Better to buy some better fabricated, n stiched woolen garment."
