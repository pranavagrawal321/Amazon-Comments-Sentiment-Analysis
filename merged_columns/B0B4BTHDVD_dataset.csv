'B0B4BTHDVD','A good quality product with certain drawbacks.','3.0 out of 5 stars',"I purchased this product when I didn't get usual brand of sanitary pads. I at first was impressed by quality of pad. I didn't get any problem as it is long lasting and proved very good for about 5 hours. But the major problem I experienced is although the pad is long and comfortable, the leakage does not spread evenly to backside portion and is accumulated at the centre due to which the main purpose of the long pad itself is of no use. The leakage gets absorbed to sides and It is quite embarrassing situation to spreading of leakage to dress itself. If this problem is solved I can say it is the best and comfortable pad I must agree with. Overall, I don't suggest much this pad to my fellow customers."
