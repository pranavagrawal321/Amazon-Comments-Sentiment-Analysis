'B09FN65GQ5','Nice fragrance, bottle lid should be tight',"'4.0 out of 5 stars'Shampoo has a nice fragrance, but the bottle lid should be tight so that shampoo won't spill over if the bottle falls down. The packaging was good. Received in good condition."

'B09FN65GQ5','Amazing fragrance and soft hair','5.0 out of 5 stars','Anything I write about this shampoo is less in comparison to just how good it really is.  I have literally never come across a shampoo that smells shampoo good. I have been complimented by my family for how lovely my smells and looks. The fragrance in your hair will last atleast for 3 to 4 days after the wash.  Not only this  the shampoo made my hair feel soft and added a little shine.  Must buy.'

'B09FN65GQ5','Shampoo review','5.0 out of 5 stars',"Best shampoo I have ever used!! It reduced my hairfall,removes oil from scalp and hair when oil is applied, not so useful for oily scalp (needed daily shower) Doesn't make my hair dry"
'B09FN65GQ5','excellent delivery system','5.0 out of 5 stars','good'
'B09FN65GQ5','Hair is smooth and strong','5.0 out of 5 stars',It's working
'B09FN65GQ5','Glad to have tried this','4.0 out of 5 stars',"I suffer from ibs and had a hard time with dryness and dullness in my hair. Earlier used shampoos like khadi and loreal those didn't seem to do anything good for my hair. This one i chose because i wanted a less harsh shampoo but also would clean my hair and assist with some growth. So, this Love Beauty & Planet Onion Oil, Blackseed Oil & Patchouli Sulfate Free Hairfall Control Shampoo does seem to be gentler on my hair and most of all I am happy that after only one application of shampoo it cleans my oil massaged scalp. But, it is not the best yet because it doesn't help me get my hair straight like they used to be a long time ago. I don't like the frizziness I have been experiencing these past 1-2 years and this shampoo doesn't solve that problem which I guess doesn't come under its job description and I might need some other hair products as well."
'B09FN65GQ5','Amezing shampoo','5.0 out of 5 stars','It controlls hair fall good straight and shiny look to hair...shampoo is really amezing. It works as described on the product.'

'B09FN65GQ5','Worst shampoo you could ever use!','1.0 out of 5 stars',"This product is a big rip off. Let alone its claims of being environment friendly, it doesn't even qualify to be called a shampoo. It can be better called a detergent. The moment you start using it, the results are almost immediate. Hair starts drying like crazy, loses all shine, silkiness and texture and becomes almost like animal mane - rough, dry and spiky to look at. And the hair fall happens in clusters. It took me a while to realize the damage it was doing and by then I was halfway through the second bottle. Because come on, who would think that an expensive so called vegan shampoo you got at triple the price of normal drugstore shampoos is the root cause of your sudden hair problems! Once realization hit I stopped using it and my hair texture started getting better little by little but all that hair fall has forced me to see a doctor to reverse it. Imagine shelling out 650 bucks and inviting so much trouble!!. Save your money and most importantly your precious hair and stay away from this detergent! The people behind this nasty product must be sued."

'B09FN65GQ5','Increased my hair fall!','1.0 out of 5 stars','I bought it after so many reviews but sadly I got no results although my hair fall increased after using this shampoo and still I have tried it many times but no result.'
'B09FN65GQ5','Good shampoo!','4.0 out of 5 stars',"I've been using this shampoo for about ten days and I am satsfied! My hair is thin and porous so extremely sensitive to weather conditions and pollution. Since the first wash I can say my hair is more soft, strong and shiny. I was not really sure if I liked the fragrance at first as it is kind of strong and in a way masculine, but I guess am getting used to it and now I think I like it"

'B09FN65GQ5','Love the brand and the quality of product','5.0 out of 5 stars','I have been using love beauty and planet products (shampoo and conditioner) for sometime. This is my third purchase. Below are the Pros 1) Suitable for curly and frizzy hair 2) Suitable for color treated/ henna applied hair 3) Comes in big bottles halves the time in reordering and reduces plastic waste. 4) They pack in recyclable plastic which is good for the planet. Cons: So far none. Please keep up the good work to the customers as well as planet.'
