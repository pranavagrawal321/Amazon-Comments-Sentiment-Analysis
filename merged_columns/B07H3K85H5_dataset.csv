'B07H3K85H5','Initial reactions. Over not bad.','3.0 out of 5 stars','Writing this review after a few hours of delivery. Will write a detailed review again. Initial reactions:  The blue dial is actually light blue. Not as bright as shown in the picture. Not bad but I would have preferred a brighter dial. The brown leather strap looks nice but is quite hard. Probably takes a bit of time to get used to it. I was unable to register the watch for warranty on the Timex app even after trying multiple times. The amazon delivery was on time. But I felt bad for the delivery person because he delivered the product in heavy rain. I hope amazon can modify their policy to ensure safety and comfort of delivery persons during extreme weather conditions even if it means a delay in delivery by a day or two.'
