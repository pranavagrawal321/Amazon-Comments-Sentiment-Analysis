'B08KHQ522S','So soft and secure!','5.0 out of 5 stars',It's super duper soft and has two pairs of stick able wings!!And the packaging is so damn cute. I love how the pads are covered in cute koala outer packaging. I am all for utility but I have a soft spot for cute things. This is going to be my regular purchase along with whisper pink packet. Now I just need a cottony soft varient for days with less flow (I use stayfree now but would like to switch to whisper as it's softer (
