'B073NTCT4Q','Go for higher resolution if yoh want to sit close','4.0 out of 5 stars','I thought 1080p would be enough resolution but it is not.

'B073NTCT4Q','Really liked this monitor','5.0 out of 5 stars','I have been using it for the last 1 year for WFH. Picture quality is very good. Sound is average. If you are looking for a 27-inch monitor then it is best. I am also using 1 Dell monitor and this one is better'
'B073NTCT4Q','Good','5.0 out of 5 stars','It has served me well for the past four years and is still running. 10 years ago I used Benq TFT in Cybercafé and the screen and picture quality impressed me. So as soon as my current monitor gets an issue I bring Benq without a question. Generally I use two monitors and no dout. I will always setup a monitor from BenQ.'
'B073NTCT4Q','Never buy , product not working exactly after a month and poor customer service','1.0 out of 5 stars''Did not last a month with moderate use. Complaint through mail was acknowledged following day but never attended . Had to register complaint on phone. Technician attended and found the faulty power module would take 10days for replacement. 7 days to attend complaint and 10 days wait to repair a brand new screen and that too in NCR area. I would not recommend buying this CRAP .'

'B073NTCT4Q','audio is not working since i bought and service center is poor to close this for last 2 month.','1.0 out of 5 stars',"The media could not be loaded. they deliver product without validating and poor is solving request. service team is not technically equipped. infact their runaway to avoid any major service request. 1 watt speaker is literally 0.2-watt speaker which they want to show on video rather than visiting at your place. Also, the audio jack capabilities is mentioned on product details, but on mail they claim differently. Horrible experience. Also don't have even required gadget to solve issue technically."

'B073NTCT4Q','Very third class monitor, customer service is pathetic',"'1.0 out of 5 stars'Display screen damaged automatically without any hit outside. When I complained to Benq customer care, they are saying panel costs 85% of total cost of monitor and its not covered under warranty. They are clearly fooling customers. I would suggest don't buy any Benq products."
'B073NTCT4Q','Good Monitor, Disappointing Customer Service',"'1.0 out of 5 stars''I purchased the BenQ GW2480-T monitor a while back and initially was pleased with its performance. The display quality was up to the mark and it fit well with my work and entertainment needs.  However after a while I began to experience an image retention or ""ghosting"" issue. This phenomenon although common with LCDs if static images are left on for an extended period became a significant concern for me especially as my monitor was still under warranty.  My journey with BenQ\'s customer service however has been far from satisfactory. On multiple occasions I\'ve been given the same set of generic instructions to resolve the issue even after I clearly communicated that I had followed all their suggestions to no avail. The repeated copy-paste responses without any genuine attempt to address my concerns felt disheartening. I was hoping for a more personalized and attentive service considering the reputation BenQ holds in the market.  Moreover in one of my interactions I was informed over a call that they would look into my issue. Yet I\'ve received no update or follow-up on this.  To future buyers: The monitor itself has commendable features and its performance (barring the issue I faced) is noteworthy. However if you\'re someone who values post-purchase customer service as much as the product quality itself you might want to consider my experience before making a decision.  I genuinely hope BenQ takes this feedback positively and works on improving its customer service quality ensuring other customers don\'t have to face similar issues.'"
'B073NTCT4Q','Good while it works but you are out of luck if you need cto contact customer support.','2.0 out of 5 stars','Worked fine for a couple of years and no complaints about that.  But when it failed (still in warranty) then the hellish experience started with customer support. The only good part was that an RMA# was issued on the same day of complaint.  But after that had no proper communication from their service staff (outsourced to some company called F1 InfoTech). Technician calls when he pleases with deadlines of an hour or less before showing up; if you are available great but if not keep your fingers crossed praying he will call you again.  Took them a week to find a spare part in their warehouse in the same city. And then waited a whole day for a no-show. Took another 3 days and had to call and press the technician to commit to a date for repair. And lo and behold the spare part was faulty.  Since that two promised deadlines from the F1 InfoTech people have passed and no new spare part yet. BenQ staff are silent spectators on an email thread; maybe they are enjoying watching their customers suffer.  Good monitor while it lasts but cannot recommend to anyone after the terrible customer support experience.'
