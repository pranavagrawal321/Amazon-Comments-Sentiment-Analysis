'B09SPPTV1P','Precision, Comfort," and Style''4.0 out of 5 stars'I recently purchased the Amazon Basics Extended Gaming Mouse Pad Desk Mat for my laptop, and I have been extremely satisfied with its performance. Firstly, the size of the mouse pad is excellent. It covers a large surface area, providing ample space for both my mouse and keyboard. This means I don't have to worry about accidentally running out of room while gaming or working on my computer. The smooth surface of the mouse pad has greatly improved the accuracy and precision of my mouse movements. It allows for effortless gliding, reducing any friction that may hinder smooth cursor control. This has noticeably improved my gaming experience and productivity. Another aspect that impressed me is the durability of the mouse pad. It is made of high-quality materials that can withstand heavy usage without showing any signs of wear and tear. The edges are stitched securely, preventing any fraying or unraveling. Additionally, the rubber base of the mouse pad ensures it stays in place even during intense gaming sessions. I no longer have to worry about the pad slipping or moving around, providing me with a stable surface to work on.

'B09SPPTV1P','The mousepad quality is pretty good','5.0 out of 5 stars','The mousepad quality is pretty good and surface is slick and my Razer Viper 8K glides like butter. The mousepad I bought in morning was too thin and was hurting my wrist but AmazonBasics as always keeps up to its name.'

'B09SPPTV1P','Quality is OK but this was not tested.','3.0 out of 5 stars',Material is nice but some mouse like toad 24 don't work well
'B09SPPTV1P',just 4 months in and it's barely useable,'1.0 out of 5 stars',"The material deteriorates and becomes rough faster than any other mousepad I've used. The large AmazonBasics mousepads I owned before this made me think this would be a safe bet.  Absolutely not. Just FOUR months into using this, for normal use + CSGO, and the material's become rough and unpleasant to use, it feels awful where it rubs up against the skin of my hand, and I genuinely think I need to buy another one already. Which is insane. FOUR months in.  Four months isn't even enough to make a good mousepad dirty :|"

'B09SPPTV1P','Best MOUSE Mat till date that I have purchased','5.0 out of 5 stars','Amazon Basics Mouse mat is of good quality and Perfect Pricing. I have used other gaming mats that were expensive but not up to the quality as this one. Pros 1. The knitted edge definitely is of advantage as it prevents the top cloth layer from coming undone or frayed as in most gaming mats. 2. Very smooth and my 6400 DPI mouse glides over it smoothly without a mouse cursor glitch  Will recommend it as a must buy for gamers or even ordinary use'
