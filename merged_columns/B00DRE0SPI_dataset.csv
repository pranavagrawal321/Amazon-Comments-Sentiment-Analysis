'B00DRE0SPI','Quite good','3.0 out of 5 stars',It is classic nivea fragrance...so fresh and refreshing...the lock system is quite useful...doesn't last long though...wish they had perfumes with this similar fragrance
'B00DRE0SPI','Long lasting','5.0 out of 5 stars','Mild fragrance  gives protection against sweat and odour for at least 8-10 hours if you‚Äôre not doing a lot of physical activity. If active it still stops the body odour very well for as long as 5 hours. The fragrance of the product stays for 2 days if you don‚Äôt wash it off.'
'B00DRE0SPI','Duplicate.only gas. I donot use now. Cheating with coustemering.in','1.0 out of 5 stars','Only gas'
'B00DRE0SPI','New Formula is terrible!!!!','1.0 out of 5 stars','This new change of bottle design actually has a change of formula and smell! I‚Äôve used the old Nivea deo for decades and the last time they changed the packaging the formula was the same as the old one. But the new one is HORRIBLE. They have downgraded the formula and it smells bad and is burning in my underarms which has NEVER happened before. Didn‚Äôt expect this from a big company like Nivea most cheap perfumes in deos cause headaches for me and the old Ocean Extracts deo was fantastic. Please fire whatever idiot decided to change that formula and use cheap chemicals and brand it as a simple ‚Äúbottle change‚Äù. BRING THE OLD OCEAN EXTRACTS BACK! Or there will be a drop in sales for sure. Buyers : beware this is not the old Ocean Extracts Fresh Nivea deo. Now I have to go through the nightmare of buyin and testing other brands and finding one that is gentle on skin and doesn‚Äôt cause cheap perfume allergies :('

'B00DRE0SPI','Packaging can be improved','4.0 out of 5 stars',Good and mild fragrance. Yet to see if it's long lasting. The bottle was not sealed and it seems light weight.
