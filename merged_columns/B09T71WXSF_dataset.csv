'B09T71WXSF','Bag is Nice but small Organizer pouch is missing','4.0 out of 5 stars','The Description promises a pouch ( organiser bag) which comes along with the bag. The same was missing in my case. Also the packaging came in a Teflon wrapping. Seller has to ensure that they deliver what is promised. Packing should be maintained till the time it is delivered to the customer. I‚Äôve returned the bag. Bag is sufficient for day to day office use. It would be nice if they included a keychain holder and side pockets and a raincover as it is only water resistant. It‚Äôs a compact 21 litre backpack.'

'B09T71WXSF','Not good for office or traveling purposes as small in size.','2.0 out of 5 stars','No doubt the materials used are having good finishesbut unfortunately the size is not at all good.  It has to be little bit bigger in size.  I have not returned itas the material is good and can be used with small items in it including laptop.'
'B09T71WXSF','Good looking bagpack','5.0 out of 5 stars',Build quality is really good .They have given lot of attention to detail like the ends of straps are covered with rubber like materials with branding. Very cool looking bagpack. I'm not sure how practical the sunglass holder on the straps are cos the load in the bag can bend the legs of the glass. USB charging socket is not available. Whatever is available is top notch quality.
