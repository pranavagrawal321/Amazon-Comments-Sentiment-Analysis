'B0B71WT5XT',"Don't buy, save yourself from trouble",'1.0 out of 5 stars',"I got it from amazon on sale for rs. 500/- it was working fine initially but stopped working after 20 days. It has 3 years warranty, so i contacted amazon. I was told to contact hp. I contacted hp through mail and a helpline number provided on the box. No help was provided. I went to another city to a cervice centre and got it replaced after a few days. Now the replacement has also stopped working after a month. Can't believe hp would sell such cheap quality products"
