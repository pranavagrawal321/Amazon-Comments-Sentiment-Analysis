'B09L5XWCNY','N/A','N/A','Lost my other bits. This case has more bits that I needed (at least for now). Already had plenty of use out of it. Won’t be as easy to lose.'
'B09L5XWCNY','N/A','N/A','Everything you need is covered. Good quality too.'
'B09L5XWCNY','N/A','N/A','Works well. So far it has all the bits I need'
'B09L5XWCNY','N/A','N/A','Buena herramienta recomendado'
'B09L5XWCNY','N/A','N/A','Product has all you need for your projects. Quality seems to be good for the price. Overall value and comes packaged well. I recommend this for any DIY projects or for any professionals looking for an all encompassing kit. Would purchase again.'
'B09L5XWCNY','N/A','N/A',"This box is so overkill, needlessly complex and yet underwhelming. And bulky, you can see it in the picture but it really shows when it's in your hands. For ~35 USD, don't bother getting this thing, it doesn't matter who you are or what you plan to do, I'm certain there's a better and cheaper option for you on this site.  Does it do the job? Yeah. But are you gonna use everything else the box has? Probably not. For personal use, there are kits that offer all the bits and necessities this box does for a third of the price AND a third of the size. You probably won't need half the side tools this kit offers anyway. All I can say about their weird selection of gadgets is that there's a good chance there's something in your house that can do the same thing.  By far the worst part of this kit is that despite how much versatility it seems to offer, it fails have the one thing everyone who uses this is probably going to want, and that's a place to put screws."
'B09L5XWCNY','N/A','N/A','No complaints. Easy to use solid and well organized.'
'B09L5XWCNY','N/A','N/A','Excelente'
'B09L5XWCNY','N/A','N/A',"'It is my goto set for working with small items and computers. If I could pick one issue - the size of the ""bits"" is not entirely standard.'"
'B09L5XWCNY','N/A','N/A','Great gift set kit looks really neat. Bought it as a gift and the receiver was so happy. From what I could see the quality was pretty good too. Glad it worked out great for the receiver. Great buy.'
'B09L5XWCNY','N/A','N/A','Estoy impresionado con la presentación y la calidad espero poder ponerla a prueba muy pronto para comprobar la resistencia de sus puntas.'
'B09L5XWCNY','N/A','N/A','Very useful for other usage and small to carry around'

'B09L5XWCNY','N/A','N/A','buen producto'
'B09L5XWCNY','N/A','N/A','I received this set today  and try to fix the toys the bit CRV-3.0 is turned in one use.'
'B09L5XWCNY','N/A','N/A',"My greatest fear is that I drop it and all of the bits are scattered all over the floor, and have to be replaced in the container. They are all tightly fixed in place. Just don't drop the case when it is open :)"
'B09L5XWCNY','N/A','N/A','I used this to fix my creality ender 3 v2 neo which has screws on the hotend that are smaller than any standard allen key or screw bit set. This kit is awesome! The case is rugged and stores nicely.'
'B09L5XWCNY','N/A','N/A','I love this set it contains everything needed for any precision fixes'
'B09L5XWCNY','N/A','N/A','All pieces feel solid and the case is well organized. Great set!'
'B09L5XWCNY','N/A','N/A','Very good value as it has a lot of bits and useful parts I need. The handle feels cheap though - the extension is not quite straight and the butt part that should rotate/swivel when you press on it while you rotate the handle does not rotate easily.'
'B09L5XWCNY','N/A','N/A','Looking for a good screwdriver set I think I finally got one works good. All I could ask for'
'B09L5XWCNY','N/A','N/A','Este Set lo llevo usando hace unos meses y como armo y desarmo constantemente computadores tengo todo lo que necesito en el.  Las piezas si esta bien aseguradas y a veces es difícil sacarlas del estuche pero aparte de eso nada que decir funciona muy bien.'
'B09L5XWCNY','N/A','N/A','This set has already paid for itself. Use them to take apart and repair a couple of Chromebooks to the great job would recommend.'
'B09L5XWCNY','N/A','N/A','Solid'
'B09L5XWCNY','N/A','N/A','Todo excelente. Compraría un kit de nuevo en el futuro de esta marca.'
'B09L5XWCNY','N/A','N/A','Great product & good price!!!'
'B09L5XWCNY','N/A','N/A','This a great set with plethora of different tips. The magnetic head is also super helpful and useful. The build quality is very good for this price point and the set should allow any person to repair most consumer electronics without any problems. The weight and grip of the handle are good and the bits are also well-made.'
'B09L5XWCNY','N/A','N/A','The screwdriver is high quality. So much bits!!! Many accessories very useful for mobile devices'
'B09L5XWCNY','N/A','N/A',Can't go wrong with this bit tip set!
'B09L5XWCNY','N/A','N/A',"This is great, has majority of what I will need to get the job done. It's also a good build quality!"
'B09L5XWCNY','N/A','N/A','VERY GOOD'
'B09L5XWCNY','N/A','N/A','Just got them and it has a wide assortment of different tips. * I read complaints that the tips are soft. All brands I’ve read comments on have the same issue. I can understand because these are fine and small tips and if you apply too much torque something will fail and most likely the thinnest areas will bend. You shouldn’t be over tightening these screws anyways. * Case was another complaint. Mine came in just fine and I will definitely be more careful so it won’t break apart.  Overall a great kit and I would highly recommend this product.'
'B09L5XWCNY','N/A','N/A','Neatly organized toolset. Excellent quality.'
'B09L5XWCNY','N/A','N/A','Quality has held up after a month of use so far. A few situations with unexpected specialty screws and this kit came in clutch each time.  Comprehensive no frills function over form. Probably gonna buy another for the car/travel appreciate the smart design and internal layout. And the price the best for the least.  Cheers!'
'B09L5XWCNY','N/A','N/A',"Everything in one tidy container, magnetized, sorted nicely and very convenient ! Seems like the biggest bang for the buck compared to comparable tool sets, which all cost at least several dollars more. I wasn't looking for the cheapest tool set, but the set which had the most of what I will use. This set turned out to be very high quality for the cost, which was under $ 25 at time of purchase in April 2023. I like all my tools organized and good quality at a bare minimum and this hits that mark for me. I use it for tablet, PC, phone repairs, and Radio Control truck/car building and repairs. It is like 3 of my old tool kits rolled into one. I wish that I saw this kit years ago !!! Very happy with my purchase, and recommend this to anyone looking for a well rounded set in a smaller foot print like this !!!!! So far all bits & sockets are holding up well, seem to be of a harder material than I expected !!! Time will be the ultimate test and I will re visit my review in several months, but I think all will be good. Only one thing I would like in this set is a 7mm socket. One out of 164 ain't bad !!!"
'B09L5XWCNY','N/A','N/A','This is one of the nicest precision screwdriver kits I have used. The magnetic screw driver has a very strong click when inserting a bit. Its a complete kit for any device from iPhone to Samsung to laptop and anything in between! The only issue I seen was that it came with a bonus/extra brush that may have been an after thought and doesnt have a place in the case to lock down and sometimes makes the case a little harder to close and latch depending on where it is sitting. But its not a big issue and can be shifted to make closing no problem.'
'B09L5XWCNY','N/A','N/A','Good tools for guns and computer and other devices. I recommend to buy it  cheap and quality'
'B09L5XWCNY','N/A','N/A','I got it delivered THE VERY NEXT DAY !!! Everything so far is as SHOWN & ADVERTISED !!!  I just did some very detailed repairs on my $1000 Schuberth motorcycle helmet using this tool set...  Super EASY... Super SUCCESS... It had the driver tips goose neck tip holder & driver & tweezers... that SAVED THE DAY !!!  Within SECONDS I was setup to make the repairs. It is now my FAVORITE go-to tool set & I wont let anyone borrow it !!!'
'B09L5XWCNY','N/A','N/A','I bought this kit to work on Motorola radios cameras and other small electronics. You cant beat the price point. There is a lot in this kit. I have have not had any issues as of yet.'
'B09L5XWCNY','N/A','N/A','good price and good quality'
'B09L5XWCNY','N/A','N/A','Dont buy unless u wanna be bugged with stupid questions'
'B09L5XWCNY','N/A','N/A','Quality!'
'B09L5XWCNY','N/A','N/A','Poor quality product T7h bit stripped after one watch repair returned for refund'
'B09L5XWCNY','N/A','N/A',"I'm a 10 year veteran in IT. I have been using this kit for 3 months. Mainly for Chromebook repair. I added a couple nylon spudgers of my own, and ditched the picks included. I instead use the compartment that held the picks for spare screws or keyboard keys. You are likely not to run into any type of screw you don't have a bit for. At least laptop wise.  So far, I've mainly used Phillips bits. They seem to be holding up well. I've probably repaired a good 40-50 computers with it at this point. That's 9 screws per device being screwed and unscrewed. Solid. Really have grown to like the case opening tools.  My one complaint is that the small TORX bits don't hold up. I was using the T5 size bit to repair an ASUS C434T and it stripped on the second screw I ever used it on. It was the darker metal bit not a chrome bit. I now just carry a dedicated T5 for the rare times I need it. However, I am concerned that the other bits with fine teeth / lobes may also strip quickly. If you're planning on using it mainly for tiny bits, I might suggest a dedicated small driver kit from a name brand like Wiha or the ifixit kit. There's also a torx kit from Tekman I think that is pretty good."
'B09L5XWCNY','N/A','N/A','Good produ'
'B09L5XWCNY','N/A','N/A',"It's a nice sturdy case with 164 tools, bits, and precision size sockets for phones, cameras, computers, glasses, watches, etc. Everything is well marked in the case too."
'B09L5XWCNY','N/A','N/A','Very nice tool set'
