'B07SY3YT7W','Best in the market!!','4.0 out of 5 stars',Honestly i don't like pantene products because it doesn't go well with my hair. But i took a risk for this one and tried it as it's affordable. And the results? Omg.. I love it!! It clarifies your hair and guys use it once every other week. I can't say it's better than those expensive clarifying shampoos in the market but its still one of the best!!‚ù§Ô∏è

'B07SY3YT7W','Budget clarifying shampoo','5.0 out of 5 stars','This is a lovely product . I have been using this for last 5 years for clarifying my hair . I have curly hair . And this works beautifully. The trick is to dilute a few dollops of the shampoo with 1/2 a mug of water - this way  it cleans well without drying out the hair. Yes  it also washes away the oil in one go (even when it‚Äôs diluted with water ). Overall a good product . This is something I always repurchase.'
