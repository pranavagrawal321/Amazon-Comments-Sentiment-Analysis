'B09X3C3JXP','Budget Friendly - Monitor with 120hz','4.0 out of 5 stars','Been using this monitor from 2 weeks it is performing amazing. Good thing is it supports 120hz but drawback is we can‚Äôt use because monitor is getting heated and you will scare something will happen to it. I‚Äôm using it by keeping in 60hz it gives same performance as 120hz when compared to 20k rupees monitors.  I suggest to go for it either for work or for gaming or to watch movies. This is more than enough machine we could ask from in this budget.  Ps: It goes VERY VERY smooth with MAC. Especially 4küòç'
'B09X3C3JXP','i liked','3.0 out of 5 stars','The zebronics monitor looks good over all i would give it full 5 stars but I have not received the guarantee/warranty card for this product'
'B09X3C3JXP','Value for money','3.0 out of 5 stars',"It's the cheapest IPS monitor i could find in the market. And it delivers on that. Viewing angle is very good as it's IPS. Good things end here. One HDMI and one VGA Input only, that's okay.  The most horrible thing about this monitor is it's joystick navigation for OnScreenDisplay for changing configuration. It goes into menu/select item by pressing down, not clicking on the joystick. To go down you need to press right. So you would think by pressing left it must go up. But no. I can't still figure the logic behind this. Give simple 3 or 4 buttons to press with clear leveling. And the in built speakers are useless. It's of no surprise because monitors 10 times it's price also have crappy speakers. I don't understand why monitor even have speakers."

'B09X3C3JXP',It's good if ur not a hardcore gamer,'5.0 out of 5 stars',"Hey everyone... I have bought the 27 inch monitor and here's what I think about it.  At the start the foam in which the monitor arrived was broken as if it has been tossed but there wasn't any actual damage.  I really thought it was scratched ( and visually I saw like 30 scratches ) I was gonna get it returned immediately but then my sibling saw that there was actually a screen guard ( Honestly I didn't see it because it had no marking and I thought it was the screen ) and after removing the guard I saw a beautiful screen.  The speakers are good ( after audio enchantments otherwise it's trash )  Video quality is gooooood....  If u NEED a proper angle and can't have a downwards facing screen then u NEED a monitor stand. The included one does only one thing, that is holding the monitor that's all...  Could appreciate a better io and more hdmi and a displayport."
