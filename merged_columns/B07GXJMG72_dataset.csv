'B07GXJMG72','N/A','N/A','Product was about a week late but arrived in great condition and is a beautiful bench. It’s sturdy and the seat is comfortable. The fabric is a beautiful quality velvet. It took less than 5 min for me to put together. Over all extremely happy with the purchase'

'B07GXJMG72','N/A','N/A','I bought this for my office and love it! I think it is comfortable stylish and I love the velvet feel of the fabric. An ottoman would make it perfect. You will love the color! I did!'
'B07GXJMG72','N/A','N/A',"It's not an Ivory color. Cheap quality with a bad shopping experience here. I opened the box found out the color not matching the Ivory and requested for return; plus, the repulsive smell. The seller asked the buyer to cover the shipping fee for the return. (Costs 300 bucks to ship)"
'B07GXJMG72','N/A','N/A','It’s a beautiful sofa. Great seat depth… comfortable. Back is more supportive. Super easy to assemble'
'B07GXJMG72','N/A','N/A',"Didn't imagine how the fabric are soft, Very good deal , I would recommend to buy."
'B07GXJMG72','N/A','N/A','Great product'
'B07GXJMG72','N/A','N/A','The media could not be loaded. Such an elegant and luxurious piece. I feel in love with it online and fell even deeper in love with it when I got it. It was delivered with care and it was so easy to put the legs on it. I’m so happy with this purchase.'
'B07GXJMG72','N/A','N/A','I LOVE this sofa. I also purchased the matching chair. The delivery was hassle free. They took it out of the box and carted the box away and I only had to put the legs on...which was super easy. The coffee tables and end tables are also from Amazon. You may search Deco 79 Metal Round Accent Table or Coffee Table to find them. Also the tea light candle holders on the tables are from Amazon. They are called Sun Jun Matte Black candle holders. They match the table perfectly. I am super pleased with how this room turned out. Thanks Amazon!!!!'
'B07GXJMG72','N/A','N/A',"'It\'s so comfortable and wide enough to sleep on! A small tidbit: the spine of the sofa is a little short so it might not work for taller people. I\'m about 5""5 and it goes up to the middle of my back. Overall I love it and adds a touch of glam!! I added a cover for the pet fur. Clearly my cat loves the sofa more than I do haha.'"
'B07GXJMG72','N/A','N/A','This couch is beautiful and very comfortable.'
'B07GXJMG72','N/A','N/A',"I usually never leave reviews but this sofa deserves it! I found this initially on another very popular furniture website, the price was 30% more and the model identical... so I decide to give it a try here on amazon I was a bit skeptical about quality but surprise ... it's absolutely gorgeous, sturdy, high quality and I'm glad I have chosen to trust amazon cause I also made a great deal on price!"
'B07GXJMG72','N/A','N/A','I love this couch! I was looking for something that could find in with my MCM decor and that wasn’t super squishy. I can’t stand couches that you sink into and I wanted something with a firmer back so that I didn’t end up bent in half when watching a movie. This is definitely the couch for the job!  We’ve had this for a couple months now and I am still loving it. It’s easy to spot clean which is a plus since my dogs are rude and have no regard for general tidiness. The color is beautiful and I’ve had to spend a couple of sick days at home on the couch and found it very comfy. I paid extra to have Amazon deliver this inside my house and assemble it for me so I can’t say from firsthand experience if this is easy to assemble but it seemed like it was. The team that delivered and assembled were so friendly and punctual too! This couch is an excellent value for the money and very stylish imo. If you like a firmer couch this is a great option.'
'B07GXJMG72','N/A','N/A','I love this couch as decoration but not so much for comfort. Live the deep seats just can’t sink into it.'
'B07GXJMG72','N/A','N/A','The sofa is great. Comfortable great looking and well built.  Main complaint: if you don’t have a carpet floor be warned this will go everywhere when you sit on it!  I had to go to Home Depot to buy some anti-slip pads for this and it kinda worked but not perfectly.  It’s def a great sofa for the price'
'B07GXJMG72','N/A','N/A','Sofa looks amazing. Lacks on comfort but I love the Sofa. Arrived with damages but seller was great with responding to my request for Return.'
'B07GXJMG72','N/A','N/A',"I just can't say enough about this couch. It is deep, so you need a pillow behind you and a stool in front is awesome. I bought it so a 6 foot man would be comfortable sleeping on it. It's sturdiness lends itself to a FANTASTIC comfortable place to sleep. I love this couch!"
'B07GXJMG72','N/A','N/A','The couch looks cheaper than in the pictures. The poor quality underneath one zipper broke. It has some damage to the fabric. However it is not too bad just ok. But for my money I want to be more excited. I decided to return it.'
'B07GXJMG72','N/A','N/A',Perfect for my living room space. I really like the contemporary and mid-century design! It's not to bulky and has a nice solid feel but still very comfortable.
'B07GXJMG72','N/A','N/A','I’ve had this couch on my Amazon list for so long and waiting for possible bad review to pop up but there never were any. Now that it’s here I don’t regret it and thinking about getting the bench to go with it. Price point for the bench is a little steep but the quality and comfort of this couch is great.  If you have the cash and thinking about getting this couch. Don’t think do it.'
'B07GXJMG72','N/A','N/A','I love this couch. I was worried ordering something so expensive without having actually seen or sat on it but I should not have worried. This company has good products. I also have a mattress from Modway. The couch is very sturdy. The velvet is easy to clean. The couch is actually very deep. I find this perfect for that person who wants to sit cross legged. This couch is also big enough to fully lay down.'
'B07GXJMG72','N/A','N/A','Very comfortable!'
'B07GXJMG72','N/A','N/A','Lleno las expectativas y de buena calidad facil de ensamblar'
'B07GXJMG72','N/A','N/A','I bought the lounge one. It is easy to install. Fabric is thick and tight. It is great.'
'B07GXJMG72','N/A','N/A','Gorgeous sofa and two matching chairs for my home that was built in 1920 and was recently restored.'
'B07GXJMG72','N/A','N/A','Chairs arrived fast and Firm but very comfy sofa took way longer which was inconvenient I decided to order the bench.'
'B07GXJMG72','N/A','N/A','LOVE!!! IT'
'B07GXJMG72','N/A','N/A','Nicely made and great buy for the money - but more ivory/ cream than i hoped. The photo against a blue wall can be a little deceiving and I knew this but hoped it would read more white than cream. It did not and I considered returning it but missed the deadline.'
'B07GXJMG72','N/A','N/A','I love this sofa. I use it in my entertainment room. It’s comfortable and very spacious!'
'B07GXJMG72','N/A','N/A','Stunning! I hoped the sofa looked as good as the picture but it’s even more striking in person. The fabric and construction is top notch and assembly was a breeze.'
