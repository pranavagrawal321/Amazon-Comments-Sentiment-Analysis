'B0BSC7BZPY','Lifesaver','4.0 out of 5 stars',"This is indeed a great product. It is compact but at the time does the purpose. It can be used for office and study purpose. The product is strong and sturdy. We get user manual along with this which makes it even more easier. Make sure that all the necessary items are there and have a basic idea how the product is built because if we dismantle and set it up again there is chance that for the item to loose it sturdiness, so I wouldn't recommend this for those who shift places."

'B0BSC7BZPY','It‚Äôs not easy to assemble guys','3.0 out of 5 stars','Need a skilled person to assemble it'
'B0BSC7BZPY','The cheapest and the best if you‚Äôre ready to fit it yourself - DIY table','5.0 out of 5 stars','The media could not be loaded. The quality of the product is really good and the table is sturdy for Rs.2650/-. A value for money purchase and promptly delivered by amazon. The DIY playbook that came along with the product is super useful and it took me only 30 minutes to fix it alone. Go for it if you‚Äôre not looking for a really big table. One person can put their laptop in the middle along with some stuffs on either side. Worth the purchase!'
'B0BSC7BZPY','Very Bad Product','1.0 out of 5 stars','Difficult to assemble shaking after assemble. I am ready to pay for assemble. No value for money.'
'B0BSC7BZPY','Sturdy','5.0 out of 5 stars','Sturdy and strong table.'
'B0BSC7BZPY','Excellent Piece of furniture for a wonderful price','5.0 out of 5 stars',It came well packed. Looks beautiful. Although minor scratches are visible on top surface and sides. I called a electrician and we both read the chart and some figuring out on our own. As he keep doing this assembling furniture work in the society so he had a pretty good idea how to assemble it. It had some pretty complex type of screws that I would not have figured out myself. Paid him Rs.200 for the job. Yes only required quantity of screws and assembling stuff was given. We were luck that we didn't spoil any. I would recommend to provide more extra stuff to assemble it. All said and done. Excellent piece of furniture for a wonderful price. Just don't sit on it as it's made of board and don't move it too much. Loved it Cheers!!! Anurag

'B0BSC7BZPY','Value for money','5.0 out of 5 stars','Quality and easy to assembled'
'B0BSC7BZPY','Product matches the price.','3.0 out of 5 stars',"It arrives in a padded box (yet there might be some minor scrapes on the edges) The pieces are well labelled and screws provided along with an easy to follow instructions manual. Assembly is definitely a two person project nf takes a bit of elbow grease and well over an hour of your time. You will need more than a screwdriver. Probably a drill as the screws are hard to get in. Can't speak of durability yet but doesn't seem like it was meant for holding substantial weight. The end product look exactly like the pictures. For this price point, I doubt you'll get anything better."
'B0BSC7BZPY','Value for money','5.0 out of 5 stars',It took me only 30 mins to fix and it was very easy. Manual is provided which does fixing easier and packaging was good. Table Can be used for office work and as study table. It's fully detachable which makes transportation easier.

'B0BSC7BZPY','Good looking but difficult to assemble','3.0 out of 5 stars','It took a pained wrist bruised palms 3 hours effort broken screw driver bits and 2 people to tighten n number of screws. Finally when the top was fixed although table looks good but it was found damaged at the corners. The powered wood from inside is coming out. Returned the product. The company should provide free assembly or change the screw types which don‚Äôt need additional tools like screw drivers or drill machines.'
'B0BSC7BZPY','Incomplete package','2.0 out of 5 stars','How can the manufacturer or supplier assume that necessary tools will be available with the buyer? Whenever a do it yourself material is shipped it consists of all the nuts bolts and tools required to assemble the same. By saving Rs.20/- you loose a good reference for the product. Will rate it again once I am able to assemble this.'
'B0BSC7BZPY','Bit expensive','3.0 out of 5 stars','It took me and my partner around 2/3 hours to complete‚Ä¶ along with YouTube videos to assemble. The material is not as good as it should be in ‚Çπ3500‚Ä¶ but hey it looks good so‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs hope for the best! Not too sturdy but not so bad if you compare it with folding tables and my wfh for 3 years will be worth it now.'
