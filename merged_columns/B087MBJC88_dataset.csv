'B087MBJC88','N/A','N/A','HIGHLY recommend even if you only need to occasionally open a battery compartment on various electronics and remotes. VERY NICE case to hold all the various size heads. All the heads are labeled as to their size. Would buy again.'
'B087MBJC88','N/A','N/A',It's good I like it
'B087MBJC88','N/A','N/A','This kit has everything that I need to take apart laptops and smartphones. Great value! Recommended this to a coworker and they bought one also and they love it also. If I lost this kit I would absolutely re-purchase it.'
'B087MBJC88','N/A','N/A',"Had every tool I needed to disassemble my old laptops and external hard drives for disposal, but I'm not an IT wizard."
'B087MBJC88','N/A','N/A',"So I work in IT and I'm always taking computers apart replacing/upgrading hardware. I got tired of having bulky tools from different makers and taking up more space than needed. So, when it came the time to replace/upgrade my tools, I took a fly on these ones. Very glad I did.  The case is phenomenal and the tools perform as expected. Especially when dealing with those pesky all-in-one machines... I hate them so much lol. If you work with computers and have had to deal with them, you know exactly what I mean.  Anyways, if you are looking for a great set of tools that are easy to store and do the job- look no further, this are it."
'B087MBJC88','N/A','N/A',So far so good all of the bits and tools I've used have been good so far but the screwdriver does not fit into the pocket it's supposed to go in which isn't a big deal just a little annoying
'B087MBJC88','N/A','N/A',"if you are after a Showpin brand then this isn't for you. the set seems alright, not fantastic quality but usable . It is identical to the photo just not branded."
'B087MBJC88','N/A','N/A','Très professionnel il y a tout pour monter ou démonter un ordi. Je le recommande fortement.'
'B087MBJC88','N/A','N/A',"'I have purchaded multiple sets like this in the past & this is by far the best set I\'ve owned. I will purchase another for backup definitely worth the money! It has done the job for every task I\'ve torn apart all my consoles (cleaned) a few cell phones gaming controllers small electronics & GameBoys for modding! Never did I say ""this set doesn\'t have the bit needed"" when using it!'"
'B087MBJC88','N/A','N/A','Materiales resistentes y cumple con su cometido.'
'B087MBJC88','N/A','N/A','Everything is very good and has very good quality. Except for the demagnetizer and the memory mat. The demagnetizer function doesn’t work as advertised. I tried demagnetizing some heads for rubing them around the demagnetizing part 5-8 times as the instructions indicate but the screws kept sticking and moving. The mat is pretty cheap looking and the quality is not very good. Besides those two things I’m really satisfied with everything else. The screw heads are nice the case is very practical and pretty much everything else works very well.'
'B087MBJC88','N/A','N/A','Muy buen producto con puntas variadas y con esto se facilita la apertura de muchos dispositivos!'
'B087MBJC88','N/A','N/A','I did end up breaking the tips of the y 0.6 and ph0000 but the screw were stripped but all around best tool kit for the price use it more than the IFixit kits at work'
'B087MBJC88','N/A','N/A','Nice selection of tips and easy to use feels good in your hand. Pieces connect solidly so no slop also magnetized'
'B087MBJC88','N/A','N/A','Nice! This same one is on a site for 45 bucks. On the xbox form.'
'B087MBJC88','N/A','N/A','Its a great set'
'B087MBJC88','N/A','N/A',"This is what you get when a store puts thought into organizing a product. It is a well thought out kit, and with the Velcro that's holds the bits in place, you are able to fully customize how your bits are organized. I will update review on life of bits after using it for a while. But it is a great buy. LOVE IT!!!"
'B087MBJC88','N/A','N/A','Bought this as a gift for my husband! He really loves it! He needed this to use on his systems in our home! Also it’s good for us to have since I am pursing IT! Love this product!'
'B087MBJC88','N/A','N/A',"They give you a lot and the organizer is nicely setup. Cannot speak to the longevity of the bits as I have not used them yet. An addition of a narrower extender would be good for deep screws as the head on the driver is quite wide so only depth achievable is via the bit in tight places.  The magnet pad is disappointing. It's a cheap laminated paper magnet like those given away for free as advertisements magnets for your refrigerator. In my set, the rubber grip on the opening tool was adhered to the thin laminate and it pulled away and ripped the memory mat instantly ruining it. Probably would have been fine if they faced it backwards for shipping. Hopefully this is not an indicator of the quality of the rest of the components."
'B087MBJC88','N/A','N/A','Very useful and complete set.'
'B087MBJC88','N/A','N/A','A lot of bits and tools for a good price. The screwdriver has some useful features like being extendable and the back of it free spins while you twist it.'
'B087MBJC88','N/A','N/A','So far so good have done a few screen repairs with it.'
