'B079R9W1B6','Not worth the price and Durability is poor!!','2.0 out of 5 stars',"'I am extremely disappointed with the Milton Steel Water Bottle. It turned out to be incredibly fragile and unreliable. The first time I accidentally dropped it from almost half foot it lost its shape which was a clear indication of its poor build quality. But what was even more frustrating is that it completely broke from the bottom portion when it slipped out of my hands for the second time! This is unacceptable for a product that claims to be durable and sturdy. I expected better performance from a supposedly ""steel"" water bottle. I will not recommend this product to anyone as it is not worth the money and has proven to be a waste of my hard-earned cash. Avoid this water bottle at all costs!'"
