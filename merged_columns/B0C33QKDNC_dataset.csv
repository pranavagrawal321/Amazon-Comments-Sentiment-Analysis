'B0C33QKDNC','Product is very good.','3.0 out of 5 stars','The smell really lasts long. One thing to note here is that it creates dark patches on the shirts underarm part. Otherwise it is very good. It also clears the patchy underarms to even tone.'

'B0C33QKDNC','Fragrance lasts for upto about 12 hours. A steal at this price.','4.0 out of 5 stars',"It's a steal at this price. Works very well. At least a 12 hour cycle. Could go more. I am not sure about the whitening claims but as far as fighting the sweat smell goes, it's bang on. Also it has a thick consistency which makes the bottles last less longer than, say the nivea roll on, which runs thin. My one bottle lasts 15 days or thereabouts."
