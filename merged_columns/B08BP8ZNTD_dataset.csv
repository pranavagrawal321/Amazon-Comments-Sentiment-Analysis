'B08BP8ZNTD','Not worth buying!!!','2.0 out of 5 stars','This shuttle cork is not worth buying. It takes a lot of efforts to hit the corks while playing both indoor and outdoor. It changes the course in mid-air and is often missed getting hit by the racket. I have used 3-4 shuttle corks from this pack thinking one or the other would be better. Unfortunately I had had same experience with all the shuttle corks used from this pack. We should go for other brand corks instead.'
