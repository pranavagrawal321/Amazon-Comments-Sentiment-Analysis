'B083RD1J99','Waste of Money','1.0 out of 5 stars','Mouse scroll stopped working after 8 days of purchasing; right after the replacement window closed.  We need to go to service center to replace it. Visiting the nearest service center is more expansive than mouse itself.  Please consider it before investing your money.'
'B083RD1J99','Best mouse for practicing mock exams','5.0 out of 5 stars',"I have been looking forward to buy a very simplistic normal looking mouse for a long time. I have just recently started giving mock test for various bank and SSC exams but I wasn't getting real feeling without a mouse. In most of the exam centers, you'd find hp mouses so with a limited budget you should go for it. It would fit to your hand perfectly and it's sensitive is just like exam. It has 3 years warranty as well."

'B083RD1J99','Happy','5.0 out of 5 stars',It's really irritating to have a mouse whose right click doesn't work. So I was compelled to replace my old mouse. I chose this one as it's from a reputed brand and value for money. I am a happy customer. It does all basic work and I'm not a gamer.

'B083RD1J99','Amazing Product. Little Costly. Worth it if you keep it safe.','4.0 out of 5 stars',"An update after Seven Months of Use. It was more comfortable than a Wireless mouse. Best fit for the hand for working on Photoshop, Auto CAd, 3Ds Max and quick response. I didn't get any lag since the beginning. It was light weight. Moved without any glitch. But since the material is little flimsy, Even if it falls a couple of times, it will break. So, keep it extremely safe and it will last longer."

'B083RD1J99','3RD Class Mouse and Amazon Seller','1.0 out of 5 stars',"I recently purchased a mouse about a month ago with high hopes for a smooth and efficient computing experience. However, I am disappointed to report that the center scrolling wheel has ceased to function, leaving me quite frustrated with the overall performance of the device.  When I first received the mouse, I was pleased with its sleek design and ergonomic shape, which made it comfortable to hold for extended periods. The initial setup was simple and hassle-free, and the mouse's responsiveness seemed impressive, allowing for precise cursor movements.  For the first few weeks, the mouse performed decently well. The left and right-click buttons responded promptly, and the additional customizable buttons were a nice touch, improving my productivity in various applications. The scrolling wheel, too, functioned smoothly, making web browsing and document navigation a breeze.  However, my satisfaction was short-lived, as barely a month after the purchase, the center scrolling wheel suddenly stopped working. I initially thought it might be a software issue, so I checked for driver updates and tried the mouse on different devices, but the problem persisted. It became evident that the hardware was at fault.  To make matters worse, the mouse does not come with a warranty that extends beyond the first 30 days. This leaves me with a malfunctioning product and no means to seek a replacement or refund.  Another minor annoyance is the mouse's scroll wheel's tactile feedback, which was lacking from the start. The scrolling experience never felt as smooth or accurate as I had hoped.  Considering the price I paid for this mouse, I expected better build quality and durability. It is disappointing to see a relatively expensive peripheral failing so soon after purchase, especially with limited options for resolution.  In conclusion, I regretfully cannot recommend this mouse based on my experience. While it initially showed promise with its design and functionality, the premature failure of the center scrolling wheel and lack of warranty support leave me dissatisfied. I will have to look for a more reliable and reputable mouse brand for my future computing needs."
