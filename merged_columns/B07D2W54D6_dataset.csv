'B07D2W54D6','Worst purchase','2.0 out of 5 stars',"New review: This is the worst purchase ever. I hate this blanket so much, which is something I never experienced before. It just becomes so uncomfortable because of so much static It becomes ugly because of piling It is the ugliest new blanket I ever owned I will never buy sherpa again after this!  If you love piles and static electricity, this blanket is for you!  Maybe it's my fault for not knowing the nature of cheap sherpa. Now I learned my lesson.  Old review: My first winter with this blanket It's enough for the bengal cold, if I put another bedsheet on top. No need for heater if we are dressed well.  It has a lit of static which is annoying. Also the fluffy white side collect all dust , lint, threads, anything. So it looks very dirty by the end of the season. If I can effectively use a lint remover machine then I will consider it ok.  Otherwise it is beautiful(the light blue one)"
'B07D2W54D6','Gorgeous product','5.0 out of 5 stars',This product is ditto the same as shown in the picture...I chose Taupe and I'm gladüòä. It's soft and the fur doesn't come out or irritate youüëå. Gives a classic look to your bedroom . In love with this that I'm buying another piece ü§ó

'B07D2W54D6','Best out there üòä','5.0 out of 5 stars',"Your search ends here! This is the best, light weight and warmest blanket out there that is the best to have on you when you're sleeping.  I'm in Nainital and it works, works in the delhi winters too."
'B07D2W54D6','Taupe is a bit light in colour as shown in pics','4.0 out of 5 stars',"It's a good blanket. Light weight, soft and very warm. Warmer than it looks. But taupe colour is not as shown in the pics. It's actually very light in shade."
'B07D2W54D6','Worth the price!','5.0 out of 5 stars','I bought this based on the excellent reviews. It is large almost King size. Plush on one side and fleece on the other. Very soft and comfortable. It is warm enough for November around 10¬∞ C. Unlikely to be sufficient for colder weather unless used with a heater.'

'B07D2W54D6','The blanket leaves too many fibres','1.0 out of 5 stars','This blanket deposits too many small fibres and threads on the sleeping clothes and bed sheet. Hence the sleeping clothes will have to be washed every time after using the blanket. This is very irritating and inconvenient. Hence returned the item.'

'B07D2W54D6','Need 4 people to wash','1.0 out of 5 stars',Don't fall for reviews. It's humanly impossible to wash the blanket. It will take at least 4 people to wash. It's utter waste of money.

'B07D2W54D6','VISUALLY PERFECT & SO BEAUTIFUL TO SLEEP UNDER!','5.0 out of 5 stars',"'Some say ""it\'s not taupe but it is: it\'s exactly a taupe colour, however the fabric is soft (mink"") and has a kind of ""shine"" to it in a beautiful way. AND SO WARM! It\'s SO SOFT and the absolute best blanket ever....just brilliant. It should be noted some from Delhi are saying ""not warm enough others are saying bit too warm good in a/c room."" No it\'s not enough for a Delhi winter perhaps but it\'s as close as you\'ll get with one blanket! And no it\'s not a dohar you\'d use in an a/c room! It\'s for winter: it\'s just beautiful and warm to sleep underand the best darned blanket I\'ve ever bought!'"

'B07D2W54D6','Super comfy and warm Blanket!','5.0 out of 5 stars',"First of all the Blanket size is 90inch X 90inch. The dimension given in the description is wrong. It will easily cover a queen size mattress with extra length to tuck it to the sides as well.  The temperature here is around 18 degrees (September, Bangalore) . I use the Fan at medium high speed and it's been very warm. I believe this Blanket can be used upto 10-12 degrees weather. Though haven't tested.  Comfort wise it's super comfy. So much better than those polyester filled comforters. Definitely recommended."

'B07D2W54D6','Lovely fleece blanket.','5.0 out of 5 stars','This is one excellent product and so enjoyable to use.'
