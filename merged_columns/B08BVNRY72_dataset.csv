'B08BVNRY72','Good','3.0 out of 5 stars','Pens are good but the only flaw is their build quality they are made up of local plastic. Looks like cheap pens'
'B08BVNRY72',Don't Dare buy It,'1.0 out of 5 stars',"I lost my Rs. 200 on this product. All the pens are in okay condition and they reached me all 20 on time. But the quality of the pens is terrible. The ink is so light I can barely see it on the page. The pen design is worst, only after minutes of holding it my fingers start paining. Finally I had to remove the refill and transfer it to another pen case to use it. But I was so utterly disappointed. The refill writes even worse than a Rs. 2 refill and here they are selling such primitive refills with scanty ink flow in such horribly designed pen cases. Absolutely shit product. No wonder I never saw this pen in any stationery shop. The product is worse, I literally had to throw away the entire box of 20 refills in trash because they are not usable. I experienced a lot of inconvenience in using them. And I spent RS. 10 on each pen. This pen isn't even worthy of Rs. 5. I feel so cheated. Such a disappointed purchase. So if you want to save you time and money please avoid this product altogether cause once purchased you can't even return it, only replace option is available.  Horrible Experience!"

'B08BVNRY72','Worst buy','1.0 out of 5 stars',"Worst pens. For 2 millimetres of ink it will write good, and then stop working. Lost faith and not being able to return.
