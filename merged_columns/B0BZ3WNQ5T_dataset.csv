'B0BZ3WNQ5T','Edit: worst tape ever.','2.0 out of 5 stars',"Edit: after using for 5 days It can't even handle the weight of a photo frame... Worst tape ever... See the pic... The tape tore off and the photo frame dropped..and broke...avoid buying. Previous review... Can't handle torsion forces exerted on a power strip when adapters are added. I stuck my power strip (extension board),on a tiled wall. After adding various adapters, like adapter of router, RO filter adapter and a mosquito repelent machine,the adapter kept sheering of from the wall along with the tape. I used the tape to stick my asus router on the wall and it is still stuck on the wall. Conclusion.. The tape cannot handle torsional force."
'B0BZ3WNQ5T','Waste of money','1.0 out of 5 stars',"This should not be called tape in the first place. This is not tape, it is a way to spend 300 rupees without any satisfaction of having spent 300 rupees. If the seller would have sent an empty box for 300 rupees it might have been more satisfying as at least then I would not have wasted time in trying to use this piece of garbage. Let's just agree to call this not tape so that buyers aren't dissappointed. So its not tape, don't buy it."

'B0BZ3WNQ5T','No bonding','1.0 out of 5 stars','Not recommended at all. Tried to fix Idol in my car dashboard. But it did not even stick into the surface. Totally disappointed. Wasted money.'
'B0BZ3WNQ5T','Not at all durable','1.0 out of 5 stars','I recently brought this to adhere/ stick a mirror which is less than 2 kgs in weight to my bathroom wall and it didn‚Äôt go well it was fine for 15 days and it started to come off and one fine day it totally came off and shattered my mirror.'
'B0BZ3WNQ5T','Not strong enough.','2.0 out of 5 stars',"'It barely stuck for like few weeks and it jus came off. I used my computer accessories cables which is underneath my study table for this. It\'s away from sunlight and one tspe of about 3"" long which raps around just one cable couldn\'t hold for more than few weeks. So I would not consider this as a permanent solution. It\'s seems to work like a local product more than a substantial name like 3M should give better results than the others'"
'B0BZ3WNQ5T','Very Good quality','4.0 out of 5 stars','Good quality tape serves the purpose very well but very little in amount.'
'B0BZ3WNQ5T','Strong Bond, Some Minor Challenges',"'4.0 out of 5 stars'Ths tape undoubtedly forms a strong bond, which is impressive. However, there are a few minor issues to note.  First, the red covering can be quite challenging to remove, and once removed, the side of the roll tends to remain sticky, making it a bit tricky to handle after use.  Additionally, I noticed that it doesn't adhere well to certain surfaces. For example, after cleaning tiles with thinner, it lost its sticking power. However, I found it extremely useful for fixing all my LED tube lights without the need to drill holes in the walls.  Overall, it's a reliable option with strong bonding capabilities, but be prepared for some minor quirks in its handling and adhesion on certain surfaces."

'B0BZ3WNQ5T','Stickiness is short lasting','2.0 out of 5 stars',It is not a permanent solution as a double sided tape as the stickiness wears off after a couple of weeks. Also the last round of the tape sticks to the spool so you won't have the required length that you pay for.

'B0BZ3WNQ5T','Bed Product','1.0 out of 5 stars','I had taken this product to install a mirror in my washroom as the company has mentioned it can hold 6 to 7 kg but my mirror will be of only 500gm and he could not hold it due to which it broke now I have to lose it.'
'B0BZ3WNQ5T','not satisfied ... poor adhesion quality','2.0 out of 5 stars','I used the strip to put an extension box for computer devices on the wall. This was supposed to have stronger adhesion but in five days the adhesion has come out three times. Even when I used extra tape it still fell down. It can barely hold on to a few hundred grams. Please dont use it at all.'
