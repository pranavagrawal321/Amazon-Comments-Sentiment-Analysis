'B010M5GQ78','Best product','5.0 out of 5 stars',"I bought 2-3 of these for my construction sites and they last for a very long time.  The only thing missing is a magnetic latch so that it can stick to metal objects (H beam or I beam or C channels) that are at a height.  The only thing that we need to take care of, is that it should be cleaned and wiped if it gets wet or dirty.  The spring works well if it doesn't get wet and starts to rust.  This one has been with me for well over 6-8 months.  It should easily last for more than 2 years if maintained well.  I had bought one 3 years ago and it lasted for more than 2 years.  The measurements are accurate and it functions well even after a year or so.  It will definitely not survive a fall of more than 4-5 metres."

'B010M5GQ78','Good but tape is thin','3.0 out of 5 stars','Overall sturdy. Retraction works fine. Tape is thin. In my first usage it twisted.'
'B010M5GQ78','Good one','4.0 out of 5 stars',It's good at a decent price. The tape thickness is sturdy enough to get your works done. The only thing I found a bit out of line is the release button which I felt is not a button but like a touch screen :). Just a touch and it retracts. Not sure if it's just mine. So I have to see about the durability of this lock function.

'B010M5GQ78','Good Heavy Duty Measuring Tape','5.0 out of 5 stars','The media could not be loaded. The locking mechanism is very good. Comes handy if you are working alone and no one is there to hold the tape with you. You just have to pull the tape & it will stay at that length. The switch is for releasing. Keep in mind that this is bigger & heavier than most normal tapes.'

'B010M5GQ78','Top class product','5.0 out of 5 stars','Thought its a price mistake. Only 100 rs for 5 mtr strip. And its very good quality heavy set. The tape works very well  the retraction mechanism is very smooth. Definitely recommended. If u want a compact handy tape then buy 3 mtr one otherwise buy 5 mtr. Also my experience was little ruined by amazon delivery as they just stuck their stickers all over the original product and delivered it. There was no packing at all. This left stickyness on the product after removing amazon stickers.'
