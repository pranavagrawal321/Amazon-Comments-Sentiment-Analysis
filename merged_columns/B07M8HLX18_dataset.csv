'B07M8HLX18','Perfect for daily use','4.0 out of 5 stars','Works as intended quite comfortable as well. Can wear it for daily use to either office running or to the gym.'
'B07M8HLX18','Decent pair of running shoes.','4.0 out of 5 stars',"I've daily driven this pair for the past two years, except in peak summers. The shoes are definitely somewhat tight and had I known this, I'd have gone for a size higher. However they did expand somewhat once I put them through some use and they're now way more comfortable than they were when brand new.  They have held up really well and there are no major tears on the fabric yet. The tread pattern has definitely worn off quite a bit, but it's still there. The stickers on the side however are coming off and will probably fall soon.  Overall a good product and is quite comfortable and definitely durable. However they might be tight for your feet so consider ordering a size higher."
