'B09M8888DM','Quality not good, Slots does not fit at all. Waste of money','1.0 out of 5 stars''The quality is not so good. The 2 usb 2.0 ports does not fit at all. Tried with multiple USB devices none went in properly. The usb 3.0 port seems to be damaged as it does not hold any device. Had very good hopes for portronics but utterly disappointed. Suggest go with better brands or atleast buy them offline by checking the slots.'

'B09M8888DM','Does the Job!','5.0 out of 5 stars',"I recently purchased the 4-in-1 USB Hub, and it has truly been a game-changer for my workspace. The hub's compact and sleek design is not only aesthetically pleasing but also incredibly practical. Its small form factor doesn't clutter my desk, and the smooth finish adds a touch of sophistication. this 4-in-1 USB Hub is a must-have for anyone seeking a reliable, compact, and versatile connectivity solution. Highly Recommended!"

'B09M8888DM','Good quality and Trustable.','4.0 out of 5 stars',"Portable, adequate quality and value for money if I had gotten below ‚Çπ500 range but I will give a pass. Very easy to use and light to carry here and there. It's not that comfortable to use its cable if you want to adjust at a tight space as it not bends that easily. Other than that its a good product."

'B09M8888DM','Sleek and eligent but 3.0 port is a lie','4.0 out of 5 stars','Its design and compact build is really worth buying. Though i am mostly satisfied with the product but it had two major issues. 1. When i was trying to connect the mouse with 2.0 port it shows error so i tried my keyboard with same faulty port (it worked) and tried connecting mouse with different port and than it worked out.  2. I believe the first prob not so big of an issue but than i tried the 32gb usb 3.0 with its 3.0 port to test the speed and really it was not as fast as i expected :( It took 55 sec( with no other ports in use else it had taken 1:08 sec) to transfer 600mb of file in contrast to that my pc port took 44to transfer same file to the same loc.'

'B09M8888DM','Must Buy for only 1 usb port laptops','5.0 out of 5 stars','Good quality and does the required job. I used it for wireless mouse headphones charging.. the product did a great job no lag at all so far! Looks Sturdy after couple week usage Very short and cute looks very good! One small challenge wire might be little stiff at the first go. if you need to turn otherside and use the other way and that is due to mainly the wire was bend for a long time so if one uses or keep wire bend other it will take that shape.. so looks flexible enough!'
