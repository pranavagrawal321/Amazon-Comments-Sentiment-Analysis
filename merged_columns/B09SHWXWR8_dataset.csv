'B09SHWXWR8','Good','4.0 out of 5 stars',"Usb player is not working with external battery. But radio is working. I don't know whether it is malfunctioning or not. One thing is not clear to me that apart from 220 V AC ,internal battery, the set also runs on 5V DC.But 2( two) external R20 batteries produce only 3Volts (2Ã—1.5V). But 5v dc is the required voltage for running of the set as written below the on off switch. Otherwise it is OK. Sound quality is also very good."
