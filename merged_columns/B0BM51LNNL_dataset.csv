'B0BM51LNNL','Good quality, but size issue',"'3.0 out of 5 stars'1st time purchased from Rangita. Received the exact color shown here, quality is good and fitting is also good as you can see but the problem is sizes they mentioned are absolutely wrong. My waist size is 32, usually I wear M. But they mentioned XL as 32. Still I ordered M and it's a little bit tight for me. So please update the size chart. Also why there's no replacement option? I have to return these pants and order a size larger all over again. Edit - I ordered it again as the previous ones have size issues, but I must say Rangita has size problems. I ordered size L this time, hip area has a lot of rooms but calf area has same problem, it's tight and which is why i returned it and ordered it again. Disappointed, but yes quality is good and has pockets also"
