'B0BRHZ3NTV','Good sticky tape','5.0 out of 5 stars',"Nice sticky tape. Can be used to hang light stuff that you don't mind falling off or breaking.

'B0BRHZ3NTV','Extremely Disappointed with a Worthless Product from Amazon','1.0 out of 5 stars',"I recently purchased a product from Amazon, and I must say it has been an absolute disappointment. I never expected to receive such a worthless item that offers absolutely no value for money. Here are the reasons why I am deeply unsatisfied with this purchase:  Inability to Hold a 200-Gram Photo Frame: The primary purpose of this product was to securely hold a simple photo frame weighing a mere 200 grams. To my dismay, the adhesive failed miserably in fulfilling this basic task. Within just a few hours, the frame came crashing down and shattered into pieces. It goes without saying that the adhesive provided was utterly ineffective and failed to perform even the simplest of tasks.  Incapable of Supporting a 100-Gram Wi-Fi Extender: As if the disappointment with the photo frame incident wasn't enough, I decided to test the adhesive's capability further by attempting to stick a Wi-Fi extender, weighing around 100 grams. Shockingly, the adhesive failed yet again. The extender couldn't even stay in place for a single day. This clearly demonstrates the lack of quality and reliability in the product.  Fragile Hold for an Alexa Device: I thought I might give the product one last chance by using it to attach my Alexa device to the wall. However, after a mere two hours, the adhesive gave way, causing the Alexa device to fall and break. It is disheartening to witness such a flimsy hold, especially for a device that should be securely fixed to ensure safety and convenience.  Overall, I am extremely dissatisfied with this product's performance. It is truly disconcerting to realize that the adhesive provided is incapable of supporting even lightweight objects for a reasonable period of time. This product has clearly failed to meet the most basic expectations and has left me feeling cheated and deceived.  I hope this review serves as a warning to others considering purchasing this product. Save yourself the disappointment, frustration, and potential damages by investing your hard-earned money in a more reliable and trustworthy alternative."
