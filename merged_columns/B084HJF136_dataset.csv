But in this when we tune in needle crosses 93 and then we get 92.7 fm. This can be seen in this vedio.But in place of 98.3 fm...it seems to be on right place.

'B084HJF136','Best gift for my father','5.0 out of 5 stars',"The media could not be loaded. One of the best choices i made. This was a gift to my dad. Chose pagaria after an extensive research. Saw many negative reviews but i dont find anything wrong with the radio.. It has fm/am/sw bands with usb, memory card and Bluetooth option. Actually Bluetooth was added to this recently i guess there is no dedicated button to turn Bluetooth on, instead we just need to push a bit up from the USB option. Speakers are very loud and clear even at the maximum volume without any distortion. AM band is same as MW so don't get confused. If you have enough signal range in your place, then go for it without a second thought. Look wise and quality wise, i would rate 5 stars. All functions are working perfectly."
'B084HJF136','Great radio','5.0 out of 5 stars','Best radio so far in terms of reception and sound quality. It‚Äôs been only one day though cannot say if in future this radio will turn out to be d same. Price is high!
