'B09Q5FJXXM','Could have been better','4.0 out of 5 stars',The game concept is good but could have been better. The person getting more wild cards usually wins. So it all depends on luck. The luck factor could've been reduced for better fun!

'B09Q5FJXXM','Quick paced, fun," easy to learn''4.0 out of 5 stars'The game is fun and quick to play. It's also designed in a way that you can add another set and increase the playtime. Cards are also firm and won't wear out easily. The only issue I had with this product was even though the box and the cards inside were sealed, there was one card missing from the set. Fortunately it wasn't a unique card, so I just made a copy of one of the other cards."

'B09Q5FJXXM','Good for little kids, but the face cards should have been more diverse in the features...',"'3.0 out of 5 stars'Delivered well in a day. The package contained exactly as it was described. 20 blue and red cards each set and 20 mystery cards making a total of 60 cards and one instruction booklet. The game is very simple. One needs to ask the opposite player a question that essentially will have to be a binary answer- a yes or no and based on the answer the player has to guess the name of the mystery card the opposite player is holding. This particular edition has one flaw that is quite big in terms of gameplay. The faces of the people in the face cards are not diverse enough to make the game more intriguing. Everybody wears a black dress. Choice of eye colors are black, green, blue and brown, few wear caps, few men have moustaches and even fewer have white hairs, so at one point of time the guessing becomes very easy. Had the cards been of more numbers with different features, the game could have continued for longer time making it more interesting. It is good for kids of 5 or 6 years age but a little advanced, they can easily figure out the opposite player's mystery card in much fewer guesses thereby making the game eventually a boring affair."
