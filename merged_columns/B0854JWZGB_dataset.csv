'B0854JWZGB','A good product, let down by a careless reseller.','4.0 out of 5 stars'This is a good chair and meets expectations adequately. The chair is listed on IKEA website for 500 Rs but we pay a bit more than double here as IKEA doesn't yet deliver all over India. I took this into consideration while ordering. The delivery was fuss free as expected from Amazon but the reseller has messed up a bit. One of the chairs has bushes for only 3 out of 4 legs and it makes a rocking annoying noise and is very likely to scratch the tiles.
