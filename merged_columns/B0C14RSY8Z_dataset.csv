'B0C14RSY8Z','Decent speed, small and compact, no heating very expensive''4.0 out of 5 stars''Using for changing iPhone13 and Oneplus 7T. 1.5 times charging speed for both phones vs my earlier 20W charger. No over heating. Pins are fitting properly in socket no shaking. Very expensive is the downside.'

'B0C14RSY8Z','Chuck it in the bag when you want to travel.','4.0 out of 5 stars',"'Pros - Great Value for money at â‚¹1299. It does what it advertises. Charges an ipad and an iphone quick and together too if you can accept a slightly slower charge speed from the USB A port. The size is perfect and matches other single port chargers so for a dual port one its on the smaller side. Its perfect to chuck into a bag when you wanna travel.  Cons- The ridged design can attract dust and lint and the charger would\'ve been better without it. There\'s a tiny crackling (""trrrrrrrrr"") sound you can hear when you plug it in which isn\'t the most assuring when you go to charge expensive devices Given that I haven\'t had any charge issues with it but a silent charge would\'ve gotten 5 stars because it wouldn\'t have put me in a dilemma of whether it was safe or not. It also does get slightly warm but I wouldn\'t consider it a proper con. when you push 35 watts through something this small its bound to get a little warm.  To summarise Its bang for buck if your buck is exactly â‚¹1299. Otherwise look elsewhere.'"
'B0C14RSY8Z','Almost worth the money','4.0 out of 5 stars','Overall no issues with quality of product but this should not even cost 999. I think that is the price you pay for apple products that even after market stuff empties your pockets.'

'B0C14RSY8Z','Poor quality, mis leading reviews','2.0 out of 5 stars''I am usually an advocate for Amazon basics however products are very substandard. The orderings delivery return replace refund options are great when you order Amazon basics products however Amazon teams may want to focus on providing products of the highest quality. Id recommend for buyers to consider other reputed brands. It is best to buy original equipment even if it is higher cost.'
