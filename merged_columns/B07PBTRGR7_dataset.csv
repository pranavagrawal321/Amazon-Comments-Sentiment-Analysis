'B07PBTRGR7','Not value for money','2.0 out of 5 stars',"Yes these seem like they're actually value for money, but they're really not. The 10ml Yardley Royale I bought from a store lasted for so many days, and this pack of three big bottles doesn't last as many days as a sane person would expect them to, the clear differentiation I could see which also was the reason is bigger bottles have been bloated with gas whereas the tiny one I bought was liquid instead so lasted. Other than this, how long does the scent last? Well, not at all. If you're travelling, it'll vanish in first 20 to 30 mins no matter how much you put on. Lol"
