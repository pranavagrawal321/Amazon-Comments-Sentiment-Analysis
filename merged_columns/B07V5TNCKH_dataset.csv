After assembling the product as per directions we found that the water completely leaks out from the spray mechanism which is not working.

'B07V5TNCKH','N/A','N/A','I have used several different types of mop but this is absolutely fantastic. If you‚Äôre fed up with bending down to mop or clean up a spillage this mop is excellent. I only received two mop heads instead of three as in the photo and I didn‚Äôt receive any solution.'
'B07V5TNCKH','N/A','N/A','Maybe just a tad more sturdy & a loop handle for easier hanging'

'B07V5TNCKH','N/A','N/A',"This is not very sturdy at all. If you want to do some serious cleaning, don't buy this. It feels like it'll break any moment."
'B07V5TNCKH','N/A','N/A','I have had this for a few months. And used it a couple times a week or less. Today the spray feature stopped working. So it is useless since I bought it for the spray feature. Back to a spray bottle and my simple mop :/'

'B07V5TNCKH','N/A','N/A',"The hunt for an easy way of mopping my apartment led me to this compact mop. Although it does what I wanted it to do,\xa0I'm only giving it\xa0four stars as I do not believe the quality is all that great.  Overall Performance (4/5): This mop is practical and does its job nicely. It's been a useful tool for\xa0cleaning my small apartment. Its narrow\xa0shape and the fact that it does not need a bucket,\xa0make it easy to use in small spaces.  Build Quality (3/5): Yes, it works, it will do its job, but I do not think that it will last long due to its quality. The individual parts appear to\xa0be\xa0very cheap, and I have some reservations about how this mop will continue to hold up over time. When I was putting it together, I kept feeling like I was going to snap it. It is not very sturdy. However, This is not a deal-breaker for me since I'm moving soon and won't be keeping it for long.  Longevity Thoughts (3/5): If you're looking for a cleaning solution that's going to last, I don't think this is it. I am moving soon, and it is cheaper than Swift and other brands, so I really did not need something to last, but if you do, I would probably steer away.  In conclusion, this lightweight mop effectively cleans up spills, dust, messes, and what have you, and it should be fine\xa0for temporary use. However, if you're looking for something that will last longer and be more reliable, you may want to consider spending a little more money."

'B07V5TNCKH','N/A','N/A','I purchased this item in July but didn‚Äôt get around to using it until a few weeks ago; when I filed it up to start cleaning I placed it in the corner to finish vacuuming and when I went to grab it there was a puddle all around the mop the whole bottle leaked out and all over the floor. Of course it was past my return date so I was stuck with a broken leaky mop. I was super excited about this especially with all the great reviews!'
