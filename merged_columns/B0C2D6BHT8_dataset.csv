'B0C2D6BHT8','Scissors does its job better than ANY OTHER SCISSORS','5.0 out of 5 stars',The media could not be loaded. This scissors ‚úÇÔ∏è has an edge over others.. has Grey handles and not steel but it matches with steel and so I love it as u see in my vedio review. And it is better than many other scissors that I went through amazin before making this as my choice although it's cost was 45 rupees more than others is because even this scissors has its unique featires unlike other scissors 1. It has the lid separated as their vedio claims 2. It has walnut cracker 3. It has a curvy edged blade which is supposed to be used for peeling.. don't know how much that curvy edge could help but it could be used for something.. it's an added facility Secondly what's in other scissors is also in this like: 1. It is of best quality with heavy blades for even vegetarian to cut leafy veggies to Crack nuts and to open bottles 2. It has nice big handles for hands of all size to fit in 3. Due to its heaviness I can keep a knife on jaggery and gently hit on the knife with its heavy blades to do jhat pat quick breaking of jaggery while cooking üòâ Loved it as it is as good as any other scissors and it is better than others for some special features which all the other scissors that I researched didn't have. Do watch my video for more clarity
