'B077NF1JRB',It doesn't work. Quickly dries up,'1.0 out of 5 stars','This lakme liner pen works only when you hold it with the tip down. However it is not possible to hold the pen down always while drawing the eyes. It was a total waste of money'

'B077NF1JRB','Just go for it 🤩','5.0 out of 5 stars',Wow just one stroke I'm so happy to buy this eyeliner thank you Lakme and thank u so much Amazon sending the great products 😊😍🤩🤩😊
'B077NF1JRB','Not recommended','1.0 out of 5 stars',It's a fine tip alright and the colour fasteners is great too. However eyeliner need to have a bendable bristle for smooth application. Imagine using a sketch pen to line your eyes. Eyelids have creases and wrinkles and they are nothing like solid papers. So the tip of this liner is a complete bust. Do NOT BUY

'B077NF1JRB','So easy to use!','4.0 out of 5 stars',Sometimes getting a steady hand for lining your eyes is so difficult and this liner is so handy here. It's just like using a pen! The thickness of the line is perfect for getting a fine finish. Use a double stroke for a thicker finish.
