'B07HD35YV6','It is what it says it is.','4.0 out of 5 stars','It is exactly as described. Only thing is it is not coated black. Its blackish in color but there seems to be no coating on it so it is easily susceptible to rust. I would recommend storing it in a plastic air tight tupperwares with a couple of silica gel packets thrown in. Other than this tiny detail it is perfect for the job.  Add on: A 2 inch screw costs Rs. 2 per peice where I live so this is definitely value for money for me so I ordered my second box. However this time I noticed something else. These screws are still slightly weaker than the ones I get in the market so they may be of inferior quality hence the low price. But it does the job nevertheless.'
