'B0BR5LJHZZ','shoes causing pain and discomfort due to hard wire poking out of the cushion.','1.0 out of 5 stars',"I recently purchased a pair of Woodland shoes with high hopes of comfort and durability, only to be sorely disappointed. The shoes have a major flaw that causes immense pain and discomfort, making them unbearable to wear. The issue lies with a hard wire that protrudes from the cushion in the upper side of the heel area.  Despite their appealing appearance, the presence of this wire is a serious design flaw. Every step I take is met with sharp discomfort as the wire digs into my heel, causing blisters and soreness. Even with attempts to mitigate the problem, such as padding or bandages, the pain persists.  The fact that such a flaw made it past the quality control process is disheartening. Woodland, as a renowned brand, should be meticulous in ensuring the comfort and well-being of its customers. This oversight not only compromises the immediate wearability of the shoes but also raises concerns about their long-term durability.  Furthermore, the customer service experience has been less than satisfactory. Attempts to contact Woodland's support have proven difficult, adding to the frustration of dealing with this issue.  In conclusion, the Woodland shoes I purchased have been a source of great pain and discomfort due to a hard wire poking out of the cushion in the heel area. This flaw not only affects the immediate comfort but also raises questions about the overall quality and durability of the shoes. I cannot recommend these shoes to others until Woodland addresses this issue and improves its quality control and customer service."

The sole feels part of the shoe flexible and rugged. The material is Matt and attracts dust and dirt but that just adds character ro the shoe. Looks great with jeans for office wear. The rubber coated tow help avoid nicks and damage'
