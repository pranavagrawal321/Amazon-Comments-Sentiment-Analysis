'B07KXR889N','Average product','3.0 out of 5 stars',"Audio quality is alright. Bass is good.  Though design is a mixed bag. The good points are braided cable and a study joint at the audio jack.  The bad point is with the placement of the microphone; it's positioned at the junction of the main and the individual, earphone wires. Why is a problem? This design makes is much more harder to identify the left and right earbuds, especially in the dark.  The second problem is with the earbud shape; the left and right earbuds barely differ. Once again this forces you to look at the L/R mark to identify the correct earbuds to put in your ears. Last, but not the least, the earbuds are not sufficiently large enough to stay marginally out of the ears which makes it slightly difficult to put in or pull out of the ears."

'B07KXR889N','Boat 162 earphones is very good','4.0 out of 5 stars','I like the design of the product and sound quality is decent. And comfort is not the best in segment for 350 it is ok. Earphones provide clear and balanced sound with deep bass and clear treble.  Overall the boAt BassHeads 162 earphones are a good value for the price. They offer good sound quality especially in the bass department and they are comfortable to wear for long periods of time. However the sound quality could be better for some users and the bass can be overpowering for others. The microphone quality is also not the best.  If you are looking for a budget-friendly pair of earphones with good sound quality and a comfortable fit the boAt BassHeads 162 earphones are a good option. However if you are looking for better sound quality or a detachable cable you may want to consider other options.'
