'B078KQ9Q7W','Feels like a 3M Tool!','5.0 out of 5 stars','Look like a 3M tool and Feels like a 3M tool. Primarily I would use it for Cutting double sided tapes where other scissors make a mess.

'B078KQ9Q7W','Not non-sticky','3.0 out of 5 stars',"The media could not be loaded. The product is fine and sharp. But, not non-sticky as advertised. Opening the scissors seems slower now due to stickiness.  The video is made the same day the item is delivered. Nice finish, very easy to hold without any issues, looks very nice, but not non-sticky. And they don't have return policy. So, buy at your own risk."
