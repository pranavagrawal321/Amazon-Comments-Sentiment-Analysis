'B0B2F2LHHL','It is terrible to say the least. .','1.0 out of 5 stars','First it sticks to your hand and it becomes difficult to handle. It sticks to the cutter. I used it to hang two frames of about 15 inch square size on a painted wall. before hanging i cleaned the wall surface of any dust. moments later both the frames came crashing down breaking one frame and shattering the glass. Result: The tape does not stick to a painted and plastered wall. Second its difficult to handle and it elongates too much. It does not even stick to a polished surface.'

'B0B2F2LHHL','Very hard to use','1.0 out of 5 stars','this product is almost next to impossible to use. The second layer of the tape is a nightmare to peel off.
