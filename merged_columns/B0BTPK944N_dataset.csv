'B0BTPK944N','Best fit!','5.0 out of 5 stars','This top is just the best option to attend a party or a casual dinner date. The colours are beautifully blended and the V-neck redefines your neckline and change the whole appearance. It has a zipper on the side to fit better which makes it more appealing. To create a sheer look the top also has translucent sleeves. So just go for it. One of my best buys on Amazon so far!‚ù§Ô∏è'
