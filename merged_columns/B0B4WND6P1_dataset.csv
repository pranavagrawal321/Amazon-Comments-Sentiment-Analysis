'B0B4WND6P1','They say 90 GSM and they mean 90 GSM!','5.0 out of 5 stars','The notebook is premium quality indeed. The cover is gently ribbed and has a lovely matte feel with the print bright but not in-your-face bright either. The binding is glue and the cover is soft so you can press down the middle of the spine to get a comfortable flatness while writing. My favourite thing about this though are the pages. They remind me of the pages in my Muji notebooks - silken smooth and sturdy - meant for all kinds of inks including fountain. I‚Äôm happy with this notebook and will indeed buy more when I run out.'

'B0B4WND6P1','Good first impressions for daily writing with fountain pens.','5.0 out of 5 stars',"I will write from perspective of fountain pen writing and the term we come across, is this paper fountain pen friendly. Short answer is yes, it is. First disclaimer about test, I use fountain pens for daily writing and usually am around fine and medium nibs, also flex nibs have not been tested yet for they are not loaded. Now observations below. Long answer- It is ink friendly paper for most part, I have not seen bleed issues on any inks I tested so no bleeding part is true, the only ink that showed show thorough was platinum carbon black and that in very wet tuned nib (in range of broad pens or more), rest were great. I also did not see any feathering of any sort so it should be fine (carbon black that wet does feather, so does auguro and ina ho if paper is not good, so most part I don't expect any feathering for daily writing.  Paper is general is smooth paper and good to write, all in all its actually decent for the price its offered if one is looking for writing journal or such on them.  I will update the review if I see any other inks of mine behave differently, otherwise this genral principal should apply.  Final thoughts and small footnote For so called fountain friendly papers which give poorer writing experience for exuberant cost they charge (I won't name any but there are many), this one so far has been fresh breath of air for 200rs per notebook/journal. Downside (if it is considered) is that its softback, upside of said cover is that it looks beautiful and feels very nice."
