'B09W5TC4HW','Very Comfortable, Hope it lasts a few months',"'5.0 out of 5 stars'After Relaxo , CHUPPS & Sparx; opted Bata (Size 10, 27.5cm feet length). Among the previous 3, Chupps was the best but the grip worn out fast. Opted Bata after reading a few reviews, and on day 1, the best thing I'll mention is the comfort.  Very light-weight, has good grip and the top layer is on the softer side.  Day 1 score : 5/5"

'B09W5TC4HW',Soft and good but ain't meant for me!,'4.0 out of 5 stars',"I bought this because my siblings have the same one in brown from Bata outlet and it was quite comfortable when I tried them.  It has a very soft feel when you wear it. Unfortunately, after wearing it for a week the sides of my sole began to hurt and began to form dry blisters. It's the rubber belt or the material on the sides that holds the sole (not sure what it is called) that caused it.  It also could be because my feet are not used to any other footwear as I've been on Crocs & Hush Puppies for decades now due to an injury, and I have super sensitive feet and skin. üòÅüòÇ So I can't blame Bata for it.  I love Bata's footwear collection. Been a fan of it since my childhood, so it definitely is my first love and will always be. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
