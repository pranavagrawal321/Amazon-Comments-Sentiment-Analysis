'B07P6XJRN3','Great bread knife','5.0 out of 5 stars',Good quality knife that does the job perfectly. It's sturdy and well built. A bit expensive compared to the options available in the market but I recommend this. Go for it. Will last a long time.
'B07P6XJRN3','Not very useful','3.0 out of 5 stars',"I ordered it for cutting bread, fruits & vegetable. It has rounded teeth which restrains it's cutting ability thus have to apply more pressure & force to cut stuffs. The serrated edge teeths fail (cos of round teeths) even with more back & forth motion for cutting. They must change the design to pointed teeths which will enable it to cut more effortlessly."
