'B074M6KC9Y','cheap plastic does not even have the statutory recyle marking (5 for PP)','1.0 out of 5 stars',"'Very cheap plastic. Not sturdy as one would expect Polypropylene boxes to be.

The bottom layer comes off easy without anything inside the box at all (right after you take it out of the delivery box). Waste of money waste of time.'"
