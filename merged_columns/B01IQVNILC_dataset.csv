'B01IQVNILC','Quality gone down - Avoid','1.0 out of 5 stars',I had bought this knife and was impressed so ordered the knife again. The quality of pigeon products has gone down significantly. The blade is flaky and thinner than before and the handle too seems to be slightly thinner. The blade bends when veggies like onions or potatoes. This was not the case earlier. Don't think will buy pigeon products again. Avoid this product.
