'B07CKY9K93','Very sharp knife with a sturdy handle','4.0 out of 5 stars',"The first thing to notice about the knife after I took it out was how sharp the serrated edge is. You will definitely need to be careful while using it, because their is a risk of getting your fingers cut. It cuts through most vegetables and fruits that I have tried this far by without any effort.  The handle also looks sturdy and doesn't buckle at all even when a little pressure is applied. The knife edge will last i am certain, whether the handle is durable, will have to wait and see. Looks good as well. Definitely worth the price."

'B07CKY9K93','Printed price is etched out by the seller.','3.0 out of 5 stars',Knife is good quality but the price is quite high. My Mom bought this same knife (2 pieces) a couple of years ago but at lower price. When she found that I bought this knife at ‚Çπ190 she couldn't believe the price. Moreover when it was delivered I found the printed price was etched out. Quite shady behavior by the seller. Why do they need to do this? You should probably avoid this seller.
