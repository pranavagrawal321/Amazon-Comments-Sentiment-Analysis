'B005IW9J3Y','Awesome toolbox','5.0 out of 5 stars','Made the right choice of buying this. Was able to squeeze in all tools into the compartments. Construction is sturdy.'
'B005IW9J3Y','Good quality but heavy','4.0 out of 5 stars',"The quality of the box is good. It is smooth and easy to open and close each tray. The only issue I have is it is quite heavy as I feared. When loaded with tools, it is a strain on your muscles to carry it around. It is definitely better than the plastic tool boxes which don't offer these multiple swing-out trays which allows uncluttered storage. If it were available in some light-weight material it would be perfect."

'B005IW9J3Y','A product with lots of mettle','5.0 out of 5 stars','Bought for my father as a birthday present and he was extremely delighted to have this. He is normally very picky and a tough customer, but with this one he seemed to be satisfied instantly. Great build quality and competitively priced. Could offer some rubberised grip on the handles for a firmer grip especially when this product is meant to be carry lot of weighted tools and the handles turn outside and don‚Äôt cause hindrance. Overall happy with the purchase.'

'B005IW9J3Y','Sturdy box. Gets the job done','5.0 out of 5 stars',"The quality of the product is good and it is very well thought out. It never opens accidentally if you are carrying it by handle. Closes with ease and closes with the handles. If you want to stack it, handles fall side way and you can stack stuff on top of it when kept in storages. Definitely it's costly than alternative. But it's worth all penny."

'B005IW9J3Y','Critical Review','4.0 out of 5 stars',"Without a doubt it is an outstanding piece of tool box... It's built quality is 5 star and its paint quality is 5 star. Shipping and packaging was above average too!  But I will be doing a critical and in depth review pointing at everything else that could be done better. Because, at almost twice the price of its competitors tool boxes. This better standout well above the others...  1. So my first complaint, definitely overpriced. 2. The steel hinges on the side are not painted, although they look great I am worried they might start to rust early due to the conditions of the tool box usage. 3. They could have provided a safety lock or latch mechanism, instead there is a crude hole at the top to shove a padlock and lock it. 4. For all the massive size... The space inside is still quite restrictive. Like you can fit an impact drill but not with its accessories box... Or if you own both an impact drill and a dremel drill. You need to choose between the two... Both cannot fit in together.  Hope this was helpful."
'B005IW9J3Y','Superb tool kit','5.0 out of 5 stars','Nice pretty'
'B005IW9J3Y','Perfect, except the cost!','4.0 out of 5 stars','Received a well packed piece in very good condition. No dents, no scratches only a small bent on the edge of the lid which i was able to straighten. Build quality is very very good. I have seen Goodyear tool box also , which is flimsy compared to this. The material is solid wont sound like a old trunk box, which Goodyear one does, the gauge of the material is very good. Handle is strong, powder coating and finish is very good, better than a refrifrator even close to a car, maybe even better. Moved all my tools to it and will probably order one more during offer period.'
