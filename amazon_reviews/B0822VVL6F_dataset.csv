'B0822VVL6F','Small in size and doesnt fly straight','2.0 out of 5 stars','This shuttle cock is the worst purchase until now. Made of plastic n the cork feels very heavy when u hit the cock. The direction is not straight when u hit it and can go left or right. Plz dont buy this n look for something else. Single cock lasts only 30 mins of normal play.'

Acceptable for kids and may be beginner or casual playing......"
