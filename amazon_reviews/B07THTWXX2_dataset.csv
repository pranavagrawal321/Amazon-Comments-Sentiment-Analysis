'B07THTWXX2','Termite house.. worthless service','1.0 out of 5 stars','This is one of the most pathetic company which is just good on papers. They are unable to handle the returns and refunds. My return is not yet done and my whole house is infested with termite becuase of the sofa I purchased from Wakefit. Despite multiple escalataions and calls they dont work at all. A greedy company which wont survive in the long run as it is just a money sucking company. The return refund is a HOAX. After sales service is bad than even a grocery store. Worthless people working in a wortless company. NEGATIVE STARS FROM ME.... I WILL NEVER BUY FROM WAKEFIT.'
