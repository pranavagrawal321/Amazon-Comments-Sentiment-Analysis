'B08FDSM563','Value for money','5.0 out of 5 stars',"For the price (~‚Çπ5/pen) it's value for money as you get 25 of these. However the ink is less & pen seems to to made with cheap light weight materials. It's fine because you can't expect much in this price range. Writing is average. Buy only if you want to get more quantity, if you are looking for quality the there are better options available like Pentonic etc"
