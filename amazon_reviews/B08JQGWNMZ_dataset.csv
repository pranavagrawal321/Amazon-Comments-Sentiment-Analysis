'B08JQGWNMZ',"Given the price, it's an outstanding deal.",'5.0 out of 5 stars',"The product's build quality is exceptional; to be frank, I didn't anticipate such a high level of sharpness and premium craftsmanship. It's crucial to keep this item out of the reach of children, as its sharpness and size is a real concern. I find myself hesitant to use it for day-to-day purposes due to this sharpness factor. Despite my purchase, I recommend their own smaller 'Santoku 6.7' inch knife for everyday use."

'B08JQGWNMZ','Average Quality','2.0 out of 5 stars',"I've been using this knife to cut vegetables and fruits for the past 3-4 months.

I have Godrej carting knife and also Solimo (amazon brand, Chinese make knife). But the quality of Kai is much much better.

'B08JQGWNMZ','One of the best kitchen knife','4.0 out of 5 stars','Absolute legend of a knife to have in your kitchen!'
'B08JQGWNMZ','Brilliant','5.0 out of 5 stars',"This is an amazing, amazingly sharp, and really cheap knife.  I don't know how long it will remain sharp. I don't know if I'll be able to sharpen it to its original keenness. But I know if it only lasts me a year, it will have been magnificent.  It is halfway in length between a vegetable knife and a proper cook's knife. Which is perfect for anybody not constantly slicing huge chunks of beef or pork. It is light and well balanced.  The handle is squarish in cross section, but I presume that is to imitate a wooden handle. The rivets/pins in the handle are clearly fakes, again to replicate the full tang pinned wooden handle style.  None of that matters. It is super sharp value for money.  Right now, at least, I can't recommend it highly enough."
