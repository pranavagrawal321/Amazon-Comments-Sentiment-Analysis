'B07K1K7JQ4','Good Quality, but Pricey','3.0 out of 5 stars',"Dear Amazon shoppers,  My name is Tejaswa Dogney, and I purchased the Fitinc Men's Slim Fit Track Pants in 2021. I wanted to share my thoughts on this product after using it for a couple of years. I would appreciate it if you find this review helpful to mark it as such.  Firstly, let's talk about the positives. The quality of these track pants is undeniably impressive. The fabric is durable, and the stitching has held up exceptionally well over time. Even after numerous washes, they still maintain their shape and color, which is a testament to their excellent craftsmanship. The pants are comfortable to wear, providing a good fit without feeling too restrictive. Additionally, the design is stylish, and they look great when paired with various casual outfits.  On the downside, the price of these track pants is quite high. When considering the options available in the market, it's hard to ignore the fact that there are branded alternatives within the same price range. While the quality is commendable, it does make me question whether it justifies the premium price tag. It would have been more enticing if the price was more competitive or offered additional features to set it apart from the competition.  In summary, the Fitinc Men's Slim Fit Track Pants have served me well over the past two years in terms of quality and style. However, the price point is a significant factor to consider, especially when comparing them to other branded options available. If you prioritize quality and are willing to pay a premium, these track pants could be a suitable choice for you.  Thank you for taking the time to read my review. I hope it helps you in making an informed decision about this product."

'B07K1K7JQ4','Poor quality being passed off as a virtue','1.0 out of 5 stars','Product looks previously worn with stains, fitting is unathletic, and not importantly- that the colours are not fast is a concern. Instructions say: ‚ÄúWash separately till colour stabilises‚Äù. Stay in fear forever that it may ruin other clothes? Fading cloth is not quality- stop trying to represent it as one.'
