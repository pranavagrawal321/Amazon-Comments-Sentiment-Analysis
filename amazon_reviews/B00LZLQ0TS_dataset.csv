'B00LZLQ0TS','Very good but not excellent.','4.0 out of 5 stars','The media could not be loaded. PROS - 1. Cover is of good quality. 2. The notebook is comprised of 6 parts ( each part having 24 full pages ) 3. Page quality is very crystal white.  CONS - 1. 300 pages = 150 page separately one by one. So ACTUALLY pages are 150 not 300. 2 Pages are somewhat thinner. The text on one side can be felt easily on the other side.  Whether Buy or Not- First of all if you write heavily, it is not a good option for you. If you write softly then go for it if prices are less than 120 per notebook.'
