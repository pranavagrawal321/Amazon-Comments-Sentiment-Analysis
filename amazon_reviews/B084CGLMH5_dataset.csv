'B084CGLMH5','Paper could be better','4.0 out of 5 stars','I am a huge stationery addict and usually prefer the Paperkraft spiral bound notebooks because of the high paper GSM, but they are a bit expensive so I decided to try this instead. This notebook has decent binding and paper quality should not matter to casual note-takers, but there was a significant difference in the paper quality of this as compared to Paperkraft. The GSM is definitely lower, and somehow the paper appears darker on a side-by-side comparison of the two. For the price, I think it is a worthy buy.'
'B084CGLMH5','Good quality','5.0 out of 5 stars','I received the notebook in a good condition. The pages, the cover and the binder are of good quality.'
'B084CGLMH5','Amazing Purchase','5.0 out of 5 stars',"Truly thrilled by this purchase. It has been so long since I bought a journal and randomly decided to buy this. It was layer I realized it was Navneet which is a very trusted company and also listed. The notebook was so beautiful (mint colour) to look, so beautiful to write and also has a small document pouch. The best part is the small pen hole where you can effortlessly keep your pen and carry it to meetings, trainings etc.. This is a small diary and I'm planning to buy the bigger version of the same colour too. At 150-200 rupees, it is totally worth it!"

'B084CGLMH5','Good product, terrible packaging.','5.0 out of 5 stars','Very good item but the packaging was horrible.'
'B084CGLMH5','Decent','4.0 out of 5 stars','Decent, value for money. It is an A5 size(14.8cm√ó21cm) book. The size(A5) is small. If you want a bigger book, order a bigger size book.'
'B084CGLMH5','Any day, a good purchase','5.0 out of 5 stars','A really good purchase for its price. Nit meant for fountain pens or any broad tipped gel pen for that matter, but as a basic notes and scribbles companion, totally does the work. The paper is smooth and fine, albeit a bit thin... The cover color is deep and rich (the HQ print looks a bit cheap, though and as a cut-out in some of the other model, looks so much better).'
'B084CGLMH5','Minimalistic design, but full of features: Best buy','5.0 out of 5 stars','Great Features. The look is absolutely formal. Totally loved the product.'
