'B094Y833R9','N/A','N/A','i just needed scissors that would cut well. these are much better quality than i expected. be it paper, cardboard, plastic, wires, etc. these worked great. surprisingly they are better than the last scissors we picked up in town, and those cost nearly double what these did. these may be priced low but as said the quality is very good, much better than hoped for.'
