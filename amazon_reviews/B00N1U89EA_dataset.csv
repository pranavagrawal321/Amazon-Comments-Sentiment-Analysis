'B00N1U89EA',"'Sheerness' seriously?",'4.0 out of 5 stars','Scotch tapes have always been an amazing product. My review is specifically on the casing that came with the scotch tape.

'B00N1U89EA','The plastic holders were broken!','1.0 out of 5 stars',"I recieved my package in a poor quality bag without any bubble-wrapping.

This could've been avoided with some basic care."
