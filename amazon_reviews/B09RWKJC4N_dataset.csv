'B09RWKJC4N','Product review','1.0 out of 5 stars','Not worth it for the money paid. On first wear itself i could observe theard were peeling of the knits. Fooled because the brand was Adidas!

'B09RWKJC4N','Good buy','5.0 out of 5 stars','I have never used ankle height socks earlier, but them off late buying the regular full length is being a problem because their top elastic tends to be too tight.  While these are a bit lower than what i would have liked, but their comfort is awesome. I wear shoes of UK Size 10 and these socks fit me properly. Any bigger and might not work. The material is very soft and has good stretch. fits well on my feet  can definitely purchase it, but as i said, if you have a size bigger than 10, then there is a bit of risk, especially as you cannot return this.'
