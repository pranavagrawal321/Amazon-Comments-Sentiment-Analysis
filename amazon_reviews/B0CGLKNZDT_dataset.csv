'B0CGLKNZDT','Very fragile, Not recommended!','1.0 out of 5 stars','So I bought it for Rs 699/, after using it for like few weeks usually on Sundays, I found that it cleans tiles well but the problem lies with the Handle bar. Because it\'s so hollow and low quality it broke in just 4 uses. The manufacturer should have thought of what to do after the bar brakes. Not worth Rs 699. Another point that seller is sending a message card with it that says " give us 5 star rating and get 400rs cashback, in your desired payment method after 15 days". So people post fake reviews just for cashback. Don\'t fall for such Crap product and save your money.'
'B0CGLKNZDT','Broke in 2 weeks','1.0 out of 5 stars','Very flimsy. Cannot be used for more than a month at best. Very useful but very poor quality. Treat this as a one time use product.
