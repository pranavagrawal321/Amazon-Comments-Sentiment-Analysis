'B0BXP3CP9K','Bit of an electrical hazard','2.0 out of 5 stars','Bit of an electrical hazard, power grid is not the best in India and lack of 3 pin grounded power connector means stray current can‚Äôt exit via ground. You can see tester light up on hdmi cable in my pic. Plugging this into a mbp results in an energized case that will shock you. If you have a 3 pin connector on the laptop it will be used as the grounding bus. Dunno how I feel about the much more expensive laptop being used as the grounding connection for my screens.'

'B0BXP3CP9K','Decent Monitor with a Minor Flaw','3.0 out of 5 stars',"I recently purchased the Acer EK240Y H 23.8 Inch monitor, and overall, I've found it to be a decent choice for everyday use. The display quality is sharp and vibrant, providing crisp images and text, which is great for both work and entertainment purposes. The monitor is also quite slim and aesthetically pleasing, making it a good fit for modern setups.  However, I did notice a minor issue with this monitor that I feel is important to highlight. There's a small gap between the display and the outer frame at the bottom right corner, which I've marked with a red circle in the attached picture. While this gap is not very noticeable during regular use, it's still a manufacturing flaw that's hard to ignore once you've spotted it. It doesn't seem to affect the functionality of the monitor, but it does raise questions about build quality and attention to detail."

'B0BXP3CP9K','Outstanding Product at 6666 rupees','5.0 out of 5 stars',"The media could not be loaded. Guyz i bought it for 6666 rupees and let me share the review.  1) The display is so big and good view angles. It previously had Samsung VA panel display for 10 years so i know which is best. The technology has grown so much and now VA feels like IPS. i watched from all angles and no major issues i felt 95% color accuracy is there. go for it blindly.  2) I found many reviews where the users are telling Acer shows 100hz refresh rate on Box but provides only 75 hz. If u read the manual it clearly states that VGA will give 75hz and HDMI will give 100 Hz. One more thing is we have to check whether our processor supports 100 hz. i have Ryzen 3350 H and it was supporting 100 hz with integrated GPU itself. So its not fake guyz.  3) It doesn't have speaker which is not a problem since no one will use it anyway because of low quality sound. Its a monitor and not a TVüòÇüòÇ.  4) I watched 4k videos and the colour production is really awesome. Pitch black theme would be best for this type of VA panels. I played games and its a perfect for gamers to enjoy at this big 24 inch screen üòçüòç.  5) It runs at 20 watts only basically a usage of normal Bulb in your house so no need to think much about it. And on idle mode its just 0.5 watts . Superb saving.  Thats it guys hope my review helps upcoming buyers."

'B0BXP3CP9K','Acer EK240Y H 23.8 Inch (60.4 cm) Full HD (1920x1080) VA Panel LCD Monitor with LED Back Light','4.0 out of 5 stars',"PROS:- 1) Monitor is good in terms of size at this price point 2) Display quality is awesome at this price 3) Support both VGA & HDMI display output  CONS:- 1) The 100Hz Refresh Rate is totally a gimmick as at 1080p resolution I didn't get the option to set the refresh rate to 100Hz 2) If u set the refresh rate to 75 Hz it will reduce the screen size horizontally by approx 3-4%  One more thing it might be PROS for some people & CONS for some other that is VGA Cable is missing instead there is HDMI Cable  OVERALL THE MONITOR IS QUITE AWESOME AT THIS PRICE & INFACT IT'S THE LARGEST SCREEN SIZE MONITOR AT THIS PRICE i.e. ‚Çπ6666"
