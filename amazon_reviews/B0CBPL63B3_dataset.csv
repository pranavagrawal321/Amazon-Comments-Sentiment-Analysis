'B0CBPL63B3','Very Poor and Fake Readings','1.0 out of 5 stars','Even after 750 meters walk it shows 0 Calories & 0 Distance. After 10000+ steps walking it shows 2000steps only. Heart Beat Count also showing very low. Waste of Money. Better try BeatXp works good than this scrap.'
'B0CBPL63B3','Average','1.0 out of 5 stars','It showed price hike 1500 rs,few days ago,and price decreased now as 1000.there was no option of returning and buy it for better price,thats so bad. Also its charging do not stay for long time.so disappointed in loss of money.i dont recommend it.A good purchase should have a option of returning it.'
'B0CBPL63B3','Nice smartwatch','5.0 out of 5 stars',"The smartwatch is nice but accidentally I broke its screen and it is now nowhere available. Even the people from the BOAT service center told us that its display can't be changed. So now it has become a complete waste for me. Otherwise, the smartwatch contains nice features, a lot of sports mode, and even give quite good accuracy in measuring important vitals."

'B0CBPL63B3','Value for money but with certain problems','3.0 out of 5 stars','Pros : Big display, multiple watch face option and almost accurate in measuring vitals.  Cons : Connecting with bluetooth is not smooth. Encountered connectivity issues several times. Not receiving notifications from whatsapp inspite of enabling it in the app. Biggest con I see is it counts even a two wheeler ride as walking steps. Not sure whether it is a technical issue but needs to be fixed at priority. It counts 200 steps for 1km two wheeler ride and keeps on increasing as we ride longer. This creates miscalculation in terms of daily walking steps.  Overall a good product in terms of look and feel but lacks in in connectivity and technical errors.'
