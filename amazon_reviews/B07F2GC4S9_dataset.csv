'B07F2GC4S9','Really nice only one small problem','4.0 out of 5 stars',"I love the feeling of the mouse, the buttons and the scrolling wheel are all perfect. Only Problem would be the cable. Its just plastic, normally razer mouses have a special light weight cable but this is just plastic. A bit annoying if you've had higher quality mouses in the past, but overall really good for its price, might even be the best in its price range."
'B07F2GC4S9','Great mouse but be aware about your grip style and Palm size before buying it','5.0 out of 5 stars','Great mouse. Feels sturdy while using . App supports works quite smoothly . This mouse is not meant for ppl with smaller palm/ fingers so do keep a note'

'B07F2GC4S9','Go for it if you want to do both - Game and Work','4.0 out of 5 stars',"Pros are too many to state. Instead, I am going to state only the cons. Con #1: The software takes up too much of your RAM. Con #2: Would have preferred some form of RGB on the symbol, but I understand due to the design it couldn't be added. Con #3: The pads underneath the mouse are dust magnets, I have dog an hair gets stuck on the pads."
'B07F2GC4S9','A bit expensive','4.0 out of 5 stars',"Even though it is lightweight the texture might take some time to get used to and they don't add grip tapes in the box like they do with the regular v3 pro for some reason. The unit I got have a slight issue with the scroll wheel where it wiggles from side to side with an audible sound. Battery life is great..and charges up pretty fast too. Upon closer inspection you can find lines across the body from the manufacturing process (you can see it in the images attached) but that's just nitpicking."

'B07F2GC4S9','Double click magnet. Go for optical switches instead','1.0 out of 5 stars',"Got double click issues within 3 months. Cleaned up the mouse, blew some air into and stuff to get it working again. Problems started again and they're not going away this time. Would avoid getting this ( go for the Razer cobra if you have small hands or the Deathadder v2 pro( around 4.8k) if you have larger hands. Putting the extra into optical switches seems to be worth it to avoid frequent RMA's"

'B07F2GC4S9','A mouse for Big Palms','4.0 out of 5 stars',"This is a light mouse, useful for people with bigger palms. The cord is made of decent plastic.  Mouse isn't ambidextrous. It can only be comfortably used by right handed people."
'B07F2GC4S9','Doesn‚Äôt work properly with Mac','4.0 out of 5 stars','I bought it for my office purposes. Sadly Synapse 3 isn‚Äôt available for Mac and this mouse only works with Synapse 3. As a basic wireless mouse, it does the job. The buttons are clicky and no RGB. I wanted to have the DPI range selection through software. Yet to try it out on a windows machine. Not sure if the settings would carry over. If it doesn‚Äôt this is yet another fancy expensive wireless mouse that does nothing more than a 500rs wireless mouse except for the awesome gliding feet and somewhat of a better ergonomic chassis.'
