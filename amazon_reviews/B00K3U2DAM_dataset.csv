'B00K3U2DAM','Great product','5.0 out of 5 stars',"I have used many other kajal or eyeliners for that matter, however I must say that this is a true magic. It's easy to apply and smudge if you are trying to achieve smokey eye and also best if you have a dry skin. As many eyeliners get dry or cracked this is best for dry skins. Do buy"

'B00K3U2DAM','Maybelline gel eyeliner','3.0 out of 5 stars',"Over hyped and over priced. It's not water proof or smudge proof as claimed. A very moderate product which should be priced around 200 bucks."

'B00K3U2DAM','Long-lasting but not easy to apply','4.0 out of 5 stars',"It's long lasting doesn't irritate the eyes . It's easy to apply with the brush (gives you precision in easy areas not in folds esp for hooded eyes). Good control on application.Gives a good jet black colour. Economical. It might be small but it would go a long way. The formula is a bit thick so it's difficult to get a straight line in the fold and the pigment doesn't glide easily in difficult areas of hooded eyes. But u can solve this problem by dipping the brush lightly in oil. Does the trick. A good product can be used to tightline upper&lower eyelid ,add eyeliner wings and helps in doing the eyebrows as well.  Worth the money"
