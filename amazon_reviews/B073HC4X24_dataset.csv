'B073HC4X24','Derwent Precision Mechanical Pencil 0.7 mm with HB Leads and Erasers','5.0 out of 5 stars','I recently purchased the Derwent Precision Mechanical Pencil 0.7 mm with HB Leads and Erasers from the Amazon.in app, and it has been a great tool for both writing and drawing. This review is based on my personal experience, and I understand that it may vary from person to person.  The pencil offers a fantastic writing and drawing experience, thanks to its precise 0.7 mm lead size. The HB leads provide a perfect balance between darkness and smoothness, making it ideal for various tasks, from note-taking to detailed sketches. The pencil’s build quality is impressive, with a sturdy construction that feels comfortable in the hand.  However, I encountered a small problem while using this pencil. On a few occasions, the lead got stuck in the middle of the pencil, causing some frustration. I tried different pencils, thinking it could be a one-off issue, but unfortunately, it happened with multiple units. This occasional lead jamming can be quite bothersome, disrupting the workflow. It would be great if Derwent could address this issue in future versions of the pencil.  Despite this minor setback, I still recommend the Derwent Precision Mechanical Pencil 0.7 mm. The overall experience it offers is excellent, and the stuck lead problem, while a nuisance, doesn’t overshadow the pencil’s quality and performance. If you’re willing to overlook the occasional lead jamming, this pencil is a worthwhile investment for any writing or drawing enthusiast.  Please note that this review is based on my personal experience, and your mileage may vary.'

'B073HC4X24','Lasted for a year','4.0 out of 5 stars',"I liked the metallic feel of the pencil and it's heaviness.  The pencil developed a slight play within a few months.  The plastic part that connects the front cone and the body broke today after a fall.  Two more weeks and it would have completed a year.  I used it basically for taking notes in my diary.  It allowed decent grip and control to write in really small handwriting."

'B073HC4X24','Not worth it!','2.0 out of 5 stars',"I order frequently on Amazon and rarely get irrated with product quality, opting to exchange, knowing it's maybe a preference.  The lead on this pencil extends out very far, and so can break or withdraws in so far, I feel like I'm forever clicking out lead. There is hardly a nib or it breaks quickly  The shape and hold is fine but the functionality feels weak. Maybe I'll get use to it, but would replace this if hadn't already opened and used it"
