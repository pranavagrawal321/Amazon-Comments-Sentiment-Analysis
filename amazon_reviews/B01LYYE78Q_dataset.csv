'B01LYYE78Q','PTB 13 MINI TOOL BOX','4.0 out of 5 stars',"PTB 13 Tool Box  Delivery little bit delayed and the box was left at my doorstep. Could have rang the bell and handed over to me. Delivered with the original cardboard box of Taparia. Very Sturdy plastic Moulded tool box with metal rod hinge. Box lid storage compartment Covers 2 nos is with press fit plastic latch. Have to use and see how long this will work. Expected to fail soon.. Main Box plastic latch seems to be okay but have to wait and see how long this will work. Lifting handle is collapsible and compact fit. Top tray can accommodate only small tools.. a very small plier and some small screw drivers and small Flat spanners etc... Since the depth of the tray is very very less. Some very basic essential tools only can go down at the bottom storage of the box. PTB 13 is a SMALL TOOL BOX which can be used to store only few basic SMALL TOOLS. I don't suggest this for Tool lovers or hobbyist or for those having Professional or big tools. Conclusion.. It's an expensive toolbox but the build quality is good and sturdy. The colour combination is good Black and Orange. Tool lovers please go for a bigger sizes. This is a good MINI TOOL BOX.."
