'B0BMVQL8NZ','Overall review','4.0 out of 5 stars',"The product looks good and it has good sporty look. One things which I has observed here is that wrist sense works very slowly or sometimes even doesn't work so we have to push the crown and wake up the screen."

'B0BMVQL8NZ','Not recommended','2.0 out of 5 stars',"First watch had a charging problem after replaced with a new one. Within 2 months again had the charging problem. Thrown the watch under my bed on one bad day. I haven't seen a worst watch from Noise. Don't waste your money. Rise to awake feature to show time is utter glitch and a 700rs China watch doing well than this."
'B0BMVQL8NZ','Not happy with this watch','1.0 out of 5 stars',"I'm not happy with this watch, it drains battery too fast even after turning off on blutooth calling the watch battery drain too fast.

'B0BMVQL8NZ','The most pathetic product','1.0 out of 5 stars','I regret buying this product .... The product software is the worst nightmare..... The connectivity with app is too slow and the app would just hang or crash  After using it for 15-20 days the device would just not charge even after changing 3 different charging cables and sockets ..... For 30 sec the device would start and app would show 100% charge .....  When I tried calling on customer care they directed me to the app help & support  The app is also th worst that I have seen ..... It would take you through the process of clicking photos of the product and uploading and then our if nowhere error 205 would pop up ..... This happened atleast 7 times  Dear noise ..... If you are seeing this message then please return my money or replace my device ....  I chose noise after using fitbit for 5 years  Tejas Desai'
