'B07F43SK1R','N/A','N/A','This chair is absolutely beautiful! It is very sturdy, all I had to do was screw the legs on the bottom. The material is a soft velvet and very comfortable to sit in. It’s a bit deeper so you can sit back and pull your legs up on the chair. Perfect for curling up to read a book. Totally worth the money!!'

'B07F43SK1R','N/A','N/A','Gorgeous chair! Large and soft and so comfortable! I love to curl up and it and read a book. Everyone compliments them!'
'B07F43SK1R','N/A','N/A','These chairs are gorgeous. I have the bed and the storage ottoman (it’s the lighting but it all does match next to each other) to match. It looks great together. They are Roomy and comfortable. My husband is 6’2” and fits in the chair with decorative pillows comfortably. They look much better in person this picture doesn’t do them justice. I bought 2 they don’t come as a pair just for the record. Didn’t want any confusion.'

'B07F43SK1R','N/A','N/A','Just received the chair and what a disappointment- it was damaged. You can see the side of the chair sticking out. Overall the product is very good, very nice looking. Material, that is velvet is nice looking and soft to touch. The sitting could be more soft , the rest is OK.'

'B07F43SK1R','N/A','N/A','Perfect chair for my bedroom. I wanted an oversized chair that I would use for relaxing and reading in my bedroom. This is a beautiful color and super comfortable. Glad I used the option for having the delivery guys take it upstairs. Well packaged and heavy.'
'B07F43SK1R','N/A','N/A','Beautiful and big enough to curl up in.'
'B07F43SK1R','N/A','N/A','Beautiful chair. Only four stars instead of five because the leg color (black) does not match the leg color of the matching sofa (brown).'
