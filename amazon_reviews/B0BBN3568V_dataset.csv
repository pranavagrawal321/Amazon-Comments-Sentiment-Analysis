'B0BBN3568V','Stupid and expensive product','1.0 out of 5 stars',"Stupid and expensive product. Why are they even producing and selling it. It's a daylight robbery."
'B0BBN3568V','Great Product','4.0 out of 5 stars','Amazingly this product has surprised me. In a low cost has a lot of features. Good reception, good sound quality, supports BT/SD card, flash torch. What else can we expect at this price? Pagaria brand should have included USB C rather than Micro USB.'
'B0BBN3568V','Innovative Radio-917 Set Pagaria','4.0 out of 5 stars','Superb Radio-917 Set. Size of the set is small with all good features checked .  @Superior Qualities: Excellent loud Sound quality with clarity with out distortion at maximum volume.  @ Bluetooth: BT connectivity very good.  @ USB/TF: Quality is nice. Super clarity.  @ FM reception is super. External antenna is working effectively for FM. @ AM is also good. @ SW : 4 SW Bands are receiving signals , especially in night hours. May be required one more external antenna for clearer reception.  @ Tuning knobs are smooth & effective.  @ Side LED light is good & bright.  @ Earphone/Head phone jack provided. It is good .  @ USB Out from Power Bank side port is extraordinary design to charge Mobile on emergency.  @ So with this Small Radio unit, it creates Loud sound (5W) with crystal clear clarity. Really to be appreciated to include all basic features.  @ Radio lifting Sling provided. It is nice.  @ "Backup" is good as mentioned with 4 hours of charging time. To be checked after few weeks.  @ Quality of "Pagaria" Radio should not be compared with other similar Radios existing in Market.  @ Price is worth and value for Money & you can\'t buy another similar brand Radio with all features.  @@Improvement Required@@ : @ On/Off switch should be given separately. So every time we have to move the slide bar.  @ Battery indicator level to be required. @ "Printed scale" for FM & SW3 in blue color is NOT clearly visible . Color should be different for visibility.  I appreciate Melody India/Pagaria to Lunch such a beautiful Radio set for Radio Listeners. Great Job.  Recommended to all ages.'

'B0BBN3568V','Battery backup','4.0 out of 5 stars','We are getting battery backup of 9 hours which is better than advertised. Its better to connect an external antenna for better channel reception'
'B0BBN3568V','All in one device in a reasonable price.','4.0 out of 5 stars','I got it and using for a 5w Bluetooth speaker since radio reception is very poor especially for FM. Build quality is nice, audio quality is nice, battery back up, bluetooth connectivity and even torch is also good but if you value a radio for its radio quality then remember, this product is not for you. XHdata d219 will be a nice deal in 1200 INR if you are a true radio lover with the similar budget. So, all is depend on you. This product may be a multy function package with a compromise of a sensitive radio.  Edit on 14 Sept... DSP chip response is good, so I am increasing two star more (from 2 to 4). Problem is the small length of antenna which is insufficient to pull the distant stations. Iam in fringe area where FM stations are around 100 Kms. far. AM, especially M.W. statons are also at the same distance but with dense disturbance due to TV towers, electricity transformers, cable amplifiers and so many other reasons. So, FM is the option. Problem of small antenna can be solve by external antenna and signal booster. Suggest any remedy if available in budget price.'

'B0BBN3568V','Nice Radio','4.0 out of 5 stars','Reviewing after using 1 month: Pros: FM and SW2 n 4 reception is good, other bands are not good. For better indoor reception attached wire and hang it in open space(windows). SD card reader is best. Battery back up is best for FM. Torch is Ok. Build Quality is good and size is small so you can carry if you go for picnic.  Cons: It will be Difficult for senior citizen to tune radio station as it is manual process, also station frequency printed in very small font not possible to read for old person.  Overall: Not for senior citizen, but best for youngster.'
