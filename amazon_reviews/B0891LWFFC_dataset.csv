'B0891LWFFC','Call it a winter wear','5.0 out of 5 stars','The linen is thick and works fantastically in rain but one gripe remains is that it being a rain wear one has to immediately open after the rain stops because it gets extremely hot inside and you start sweating profusely.'

'B0891LWFFC','Just Zeel it','4.0 out of 5 stars',"Using it in this second rainy season. Zeel is well-known brand for raincoats and it simply keeps it's legacy in market by providing quality products.  *Upper coating is not 100% waterproof it has a reason that to absorb the hit of water drops and sound of that hitting. And cheat the wind without making noise.  *The undercoating ensures 100% waterproofing  * I never used it as reversed, they advertise it as reversible but I wear it in simple straight way.  The only con is that the pant is too bulky for me and the length is little bit less as my fittings. So when I drive bike wearing it, my jeans remains uncovered like 6-7 inches from bottom. And all that road muddy water plays on that of my jeans area.  I hope they can price it at reasonable rates.  If you find this review helpful please like it so it can help others too."
