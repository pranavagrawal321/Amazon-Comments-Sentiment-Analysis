'B077J67HK6','Great product but not satisfied','3.0 out of 5 stars',"Product is really great. Have really good quality and sturdy. But only thing I doesn't like is its wheels. I bought 4000 RS worth product. Wheels are not work on asphalt or irregular path ways. It stucks there. I had to buy black and Decker trolley which had really good big grippy wheels and have higher loading capacity with third of the price"
'B077J67HK6','delivery of old & used and defective/inoperative product','1.0 out of 5 stars','Nobody came to pick up the old & used and defective Stanley folding hand truck on 1.1.22 or tried to contact me. Do not misinform ; it is serious shirking of responsibility of the seller/Amazon'
'B077J67HK6','Excellent product!','5.0 out of 5 stars','Loved it! Sturdy, reliable, and gets the job done‚Ä¶'
'B077J67HK6','Its good but not best','3.0 out of 5 stars','The wheels have bush instead of bearings in wheels which makes the wheels wobble and also rivetted wheels, which would create issues if needed a replacement. I would suggest to go for a bigger size 582 which has bearings in wheels and bolts with nuts for wheels and is better in stability and weight capacity. also metal pipes are lighter and of less dia. than 582. If you are ready to spend a little more go for the bigger 582 model.'

'B077J67HK6','Great design. Impressive.','4.0 out of 5 stars','It could not be used for the purpose I bought. The problem is to move heavy objects on to the trolley. I could not do that so it is little practical use for me. Perhaps the designer should think of makiing it more practical instead of concentrating on non essentials. Great looking gadget, but of little use.üòëüòí'
