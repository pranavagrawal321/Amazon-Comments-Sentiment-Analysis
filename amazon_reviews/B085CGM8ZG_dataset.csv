'B085CGM8ZG','Dries out quickly','2.0 out of 5 stars','I have read review online and that was good, so I purchased this one, but it is not match what it says or with those positive review on Google or YouTube, it dries out quickly, while applying you have to outline 2-3 times, over and over again, to get the exact black colour and it was really a disappointment, I have used Maybelline gloss intense eyeliner earlier and that is better than this, and that will be stupidity to compare this product with Maybelline eyeliner. This time I decided to try something new and that was my worst decision. I have wasted money. I will go back to my Maybelline eyeliner. üòå'
