'B07XMFDHSG',"One of the best tech product I've ever bought.",'5.0 out of 5 stars',"So first of all- Sound Quality - 9.5/10 Wire quality/overall build quality - 9/10 Durability 20/10  It's been 3 years and just today my left earphone stopped working. To be blunt, if you want to have a wired earphone it's the best you can get. Instead of buying cheap one which will only last you for couple of weeks or months with terrible sound quality, this earphone will last you years with one of the best sound quality I've heard so far. For sure a value for money purchase. Thanks for Reading..."
