'B07QRXPPFD','Comfortable to use','3.0 out of 5 stars',"As you can see it's smaller in size as compared to the size chart,its better to go for one size bigger..I ordered a size of 7 but compared to other slippers it is few centimetres smaller..

'B07QRXPPFD','Cozy Comfort for Indoor Bliss!','4.0 out of 5 stars',"I recently purchased the Sparx Women's Velvet Basic Flip-Flops and House Slippers, and I'm absolutely thrilled with my purchase. These are not just your ordinary flip-flops; they're a whole new level of comfort and luxury for your feet. The fit is true to size, and the simple yet stylish design goes well with various outfits. The straps are gentle on my feet and don't cause any discomfort, even after extended wear. The non-slip sole gives me confidence when walking on various surfaces around the house. Cleaning these flip-flops is a breeze too. I was a bit worried about how the velvet would hold up, but they've proven to be quite resilient. A quick wipe with a damp cloth is all it takes to keep them looking as good as new."

'B07QRXPPFD','Fitting and comfort','2.0 out of 5 stars',"The straps are small and seem unequal between left and right. the left foot doesn't go in fully and rests at an angle on the sole, photo attached. The sole is too thin. I have been using size 6 of flite for floaters, sandals and other outdoor chappals for the last 4-5 years. But this pair i had to order size 8 and even then it is most uncomfortable."
