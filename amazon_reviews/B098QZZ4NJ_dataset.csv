'B098QZZ4NJ','Product stopped working in 2 to 3 weeks.','1.0 out of 5 stars','Product stopped working in 2 to 3 weeks. when contacted amazon, they diverted me to manufacturer. Their phone number is not working. Went to website and Registered a warranty claim with Portronics.com and waiting a feedback from them. Time and again portronics has put me down. Every time I still give them a chance and buy their product, with same thing repeating. I have earlier ordered their wireless charger stand, which also turned out to be big failure within few weeks of purchase.'

'B098QZZ4NJ','Lifesaver for me','5.0 out of 5 stars',"The Portronics Power Plate 5 has been an absolute lifesaver for me! When I returned from the US with a charger that didn't fit into Indian sockets, I was in a bind. This power converter came to the rescue.  Not only does it have 3 AC sockets that accommodate various types of plugs, but it also boasts 3 USB ports, which is incredibly convenient for charging multiple devices simultaneously. The 1500W power capacity ensures that I can power all my devices without any issues.  What sets this converter apart is the thoughtful addition of a mobile holder, making it a versatile and practical accessory. The 1.5-meter cord length gives me flexibility in placing it where I need it most.  Overall, the Portronics Power Plate 5 has simplified my charging needs and provided a reliable solution for my US chargers in India. It's a must-have for travelers and anyone dealing with different plug types. Highly recommended! üëçüîå"

'B098QZZ4NJ','Overall seems OK, but wire could be little longer','4.0 out of 5 stars','Performance of the extension cord is ok as of now, however I feel length of wire should be little longer.'
'B098QZZ4NJ','Ok ok','2.0 out of 5 stars','The wire is small than expected. The regular socket is difficult to insert .does not heat up fast..does not fire up while charging.'
'B098QZZ4NJ','Nice to buy','5.0 out of 5 stars','The media could not be loaded. Keep in mind the length is not too much you can‚Äôt extend for too long. But all ports and USB ports also work like charms. It‚Äôs very easy to use and the appearance is top class if you purchase white it looks good. Special thanks to the portability also.'
