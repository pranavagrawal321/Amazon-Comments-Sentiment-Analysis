Makes the Logitech wireless M171 mouse lag painfully. I had to switch to a wired mouse. Huge turn off - asks for contacts access when connected to phone. Privacy literate folks can avoid this.'

'B00MUTWLW4','Excellent Multi-Device Keyboard for Seamless Productivity','5.0 out of 5 stars',"I've been using the Logitech K480 keyboard for the past year, and it has exceeded my expectations in every way. This versatile keyboard has become an indispensable tool in my daily routine, and I'm thrilled to share my experiences with it.

Its compact and stylish design fits well into any workspace, and the built-in device cradle is a thoughtful addition. The keyboard is comfortable to type on, with well-spaced keys and a pleasant tactile response.

Thanks to the Logitech app, I can effortlessly pair it with my PC and tablet simultaneously. The device switching is incredibly smooth and efficient, enhancing my productivity, whether I'm working on a report on my PC or browsing content on my tablet.  Space Bar Lock System: Initially, I wasn't aware of the space bar's lock system, but once I discovered it, it added an extra layer of convenience to my workflow. A simple click on the space bar allows me to switch between devices effortlessly. It's a small feature, but it makes a big difference in usability.  Compatibility: I use this keyboard with my Samsung Tab S8, and it fits perfectly, providing a comfortable and efficient typing experience. The Logitech K480 is designed to work seamlessly with various operating systems, making it a versatile choice for users with different devices.  Logitech App: The Logitech app (logi Option + )enhances the overall experience, allowing for easy customization of function keys and device management. It's user-friendly and adds a layer of personalization to the keyboard's functionality.  In conclusion, the Logitech K480 is the best keyboard I've used in recent years. Its exceptional build quality, multi-device connectivity, and thoughtful features like the space bar lock system have significantly improved my productivity. Whether you're a professional working across multiple devices or a student juggling assignments, this keyboard is a game-changer. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable and versatile keyboard. It's a fantastic investment that continues to impress me day after day."
'B00MUTWLW4','Can be used for short term use','3.0 out of 5 stars','Its been close to two weeks since I started using this keyboard. Some of the pros & cons are below: Positives: - Connects to multiple devices at ease - There is no lag from tying and reflection on the screen - Reasonable price Negatives: - Keys are not smooth. Conscious effort is required to key in the letters, especially if you are used to smooth keys on laptop keyboards. Hence this brings down the speed of typing - If you are looking for a smooth experience with the keyboard then this is not the one for you. Can be used for short-term use with iPads , mobiles but not for long hours of usage or WFH set-up. You will feel the pain in the hands and will get frustrated as your thought process will slow down as you need to focus on putting effort in typing the right keys.'
'B00MUTWLW4','got damaged product','1.0 out of 5 stars','keys got damaged'
'B00MUTWLW4','Much better keyboards available at lesser price','3.0 out of 5 stars',"Apart from multi connectivity feature, there isn't much noticeable feature in this keyboard. Keys are rough and not smooth, typing is a bit difficult considering the size of key. Not for daily office use. Can be used if u have 2 systems, but i rarely see that scenario. Keys are noisey. Buy yes, the built quality is much better than other keyboards in this segment."
'B00MUTWLW4','All Good but little expensive','4.0 out of 5 stars','Everything is good but at this price point it would be great if mouse was also included and also if inated of pencil batteries it would have been chargable ones than that would be great.'
'B00MUTWLW4','Ok','3.0 out of 5 stars','its ok product but I want to return it but do not have the option.'
'B00MUTWLW4','Awesome','5.0 out of 5 stars','This is really awesome product, I have been using for mob and tab simultaneously.  Looks, connectivity, response time is just awesome. I rate 5star'
'B00MUTWLW4','Good quality.','4.0 out of 5 stars','Small in size. Quality is good. But it is bit heavy. Multi device connect . Bit Noisy on pressing key.'
'B00MUTWLW4','Worst Bluetooth connectivity','1.0 out of 5 stars','I had an issue with Bluetooth connectivity. So that , I have exchanged this with another new k480. Again I am having same Bluetooth connectivity issue. Worst product from Logitech'
'B00MUTWLW4','Working fine','5.0 out of 5 stars','Good choice in this segment,'
'B00MUTWLW4','Poor battery issue','1.0 out of 5 stars','For a year it worked very well. Now the battery doesnt even last 5 days. Not sure whats happening'
'B00MUTWLW4','Excellent quality works very well with Xiaomi pad 6','5.0 out of 5 stars',"I am using this with Xiaomi pad 6 and it works very well, white color really looks awesome, from quality point of view I will say its much better , its sturdy, little heavy but works well, keys are soft and has clicking sound that gives the feel of actual big keyboard. I was planning to for Xiaomi's own keyboard but changed decision to Logitech k480 as this one can be used with multiple devices rather than just using with pad 6. The synch happened in few seconds and there is no lag while typing."
'B00MUTWLW4','Typrewriter','1.0 out of 5 stars',"I purchased it as I have Mac from my client and Dell from my organisation. Also I had started to suffer back pain so I purchased a laptop stand and this keyboard.  I am a techie and I love gadgets so I was extremely excited that these will give my study and workstation a new feel.  But ewwww.... the keys are so tight and pressing them you get the sasta typewriter sounds of 'kat-kat-kat-kat'. Gosh! 2.5k down in drain !!!!!  TIP: Go out to tech stores - feel various available keyboard - explore who is giving the best deal (online/offline) - then purchase it. Remember - this is something you will touch for several hours everyday for years - so don't simply rely on text comments - go out and experience yourself."
'B00MUTWLW4','Utility beast','5.0 out of 5 stars','Very good ,its a bit heavy, but the weight is necessary for the tabs/ipads to stay put, switching between devices works like a charm. The batteries included are good as well. If i had to split hairs, it has to be the noisy clicks.'
'B00MUTWLW4','good product at this price','5.0 out of 5 stars','good product at this price'
'B00MUTWLW4','Heavy keyboard.. looks smaller in pictures','2.0 out of 5 stars','Am quite disappointed with the keyboard. For a wireless one, it is quite heavy, hence not quite portable. Would have returned it if Amazon allowed returns on this product. Now am stuck with it.'
'B00MUTWLW4','Good one in this price','5.0 out of 5 stars','Very nice one.'
'B00MUTWLW4','Do not buy it online. It’s not worth replacement as well.','1.0 out of 5 stars','The keys were not working on my first purchase and then I went ahead and replaced it. The next item that came, it’s been so difficult for me to use it because the keyboard keeps on getting disconnected from my iPad.'
'B00MUTWLW4','Excellent Keyboard.','5.0 out of 5 stars','Excellent Keyboard.'
'B00MUTWLW4','best','4.0 out of 5 stars','no issue with connectivity and device switching and battery life is also good. only problem is that i was used to back-light keyboard. so it is hard to use it in dark, low light room or in night.'
'B00MUTWLW4','Build quality','5.0 out of 5 stars','Awesome excellent keyboard. Sturdy build quality and super useful.'
'B00MUTWLW4','Good but expensive','4.0 out of 5 stars','Good but expensive'
'B00MUTWLW4','Works fine, but no servicing option post the warranty period','3.0 out of 5 stars','I was quite happy with this keyboard and was using this for my everyday use until few days back when it suddenly stopped working and would not power up even after replacing the batteries. Called up the Logitech to know if I can get any directions for their authorized service centers. Sadly, they dont do any servicing even after warranty period is over. During warranty they only replace the item. Post warranty, you are on your own with no service support from the company even if the customer is ready to pay. Spending more than 2.2k on a keyboard which works only for a year cannot be called economical. There are other lesser known brand wireless keyboards that comes under 1k and works for years together.'
'B00MUTWLW4','Urgent: Request for Refund and Resolution Regarding Defective Keyboard','1.0 out of 5 stars',"The keyboard I received is in poor condition, with keys not functioning properly. After requesting a replacement, I received a new one, but unfortunately, it's still in the same condition. I am very disappointed, especially since there is no option for a return, only a replacement. I kindly request that you consider accepting the keyboard back and providing a refund. I appreciate your attention to this matter. Thank you."
'B00MUTWLW4','Food','4.0 out of 5 stars','I feel one con in this product that is high weight other than that all are good 👍'
'B00MUTWLW4','Easy to use, not great typing experience','4.0 out of 5 stars','The keyboard is easy to use and we can connect easily to multiple devices using the radio button. However the typing experience is not that great. Not as smooth as the one I have while using laptop keyboard to type.'
'B00MUTWLW4','Very usefull','3.0 out of 5 stars','Awesome easy to carry but little heavy'
'B00MUTWLW4',"Value For Money it's really Good Product.",'5.0 out of 5 stars',"it's really very good product by Logitech company I like it and am happy with using it."
'B00MUTWLW4','Useless','1.0 out of 5 stars','Nonsense Product'
'B00MUTWLW4','Great Connectivity. Good Features. Terrible Keys.','3.0 out of 5 stars',"The product is as it has been advertised. The Good: It's a small compact keyboard with 3 separate bluetooth profiles for use with 3 separate devices. The bluetooth range is acceptable and the keyboard looks very chic. It accomadates an iPad perfectly in the slot and there are no pairing issues.  The bad: The actual keys are absolutely terrible. They have to be struck at just the right angle in just the right way or they feel jammy and wont trigger. The backspace key in particular is just a pain to press. I may be biased because my previous keyboard before this was a mechanical one, but even for an average cheap keyboard, the keystroke design is not good at all. What's the point of having all these cool features when you can't type properly.  Verdict: I wish I hasn't purchased it. Too pricy and doesn't work well."
'B00MUTWLW4','Full keyboard is better','2.0 out of 5 stars','Go for other model, this is bulky and very small.'
'B00MUTWLW4','Good Product','5.0 out of 5 stars','Very nice product'
'B00MUTWLW4','Keyboard feels heavy, both in its package and while typing .','3.0 out of 5 stars',"The new keyboard feels heavy, both in its package and while typing due to its weight. The keys lack smoothness and produce noise. Setup is easy, and it comes with a tablet/phone holder for added functionality. However, its weight makes it less portable, even though the tablet holder has secure rubber grips. The keyboard's stability benefits from its heaviness, but the keys are on the smaller side. It's unclear why the keyboard is so heavy when it uses AAA replaceable batteries."
'B00MUTWLW4','Would have rated 5.','4.0 out of 5 stars','I wanted this product for a long time. The white model is too beautiful. I have been using this product for a week continously with my smartphone and here are some the things i found out: 1. size is accurate - not too big, not too small, can carry easily while travelling. 2. the keys are soft to work on. 3. lots of shortcut key options 4. I would have loved a manual with the product on guiding about certain keys\' use with the devices. 5. The reason i didn\'t give 5 star to this otherwise perfect product is because of one silly flaw - when i am pressing shift key and number 2 key instead of getting @, i am getting " and vice versa. I got the product relaced but the replaced product is also having the same issue, which means its a manufacturing defect.'
'B00MUTWLW4','Its heavy, No kidding','4.0 out of 5 stars','Typing in the new keyboard after few minutes of usage, the first thing you notice is that the package is heavy and then that the keyboard itself weighs a lot, keys are not smooth, makes noise. Easy to setup Has a place to hold tablet/phone, converts it to a mini laptop. But this keyboard is less portable because its heavy. The tablet holder has soft rubber to hold tablet without letting it fall Its more stable because of its weight Keys are small too. I just dont know why its so heavy when the batteries are aaa replacable'
'B00MUTWLW4','Defective product','1.0 out of 5 stars','Received this keyboard with some of the keys not responding defective product in packing Tried to replace next day and no one came to pick up or exchange Worst experience with this company'
