'B0BJ72WZQ7','Watch is awsm and just asked for a small help from someone who acquire the knowledge about it','4.0 out of 5 stars','The watch is amazing, bought it a while back and the working condition is just awsm. Few problems i faced on the connectivity with the phone, other than that the watch is next level. I recently broke the screen of this watch by accident and i require a replacement display for it. If anyone have a knowledge for changing the display from some place in bangalore like a service centre or something. It would be a great help. If anyone knows where i could purchase the display and get it replaced in Bangalore, please reply to this comment. It would be a life-saver. Thank you.'
