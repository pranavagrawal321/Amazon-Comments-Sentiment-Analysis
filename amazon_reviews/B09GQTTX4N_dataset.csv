'B09GQTTX4N','Compatible with i products','4.0 out of 5 stars',"This is belkins 30W charging adapter. It is small and less in weight compare to regular 30W apple charging adapter.

'B09GQTTX4N','Trusted brand but important catch','4.0 out of 5 stars',"I bought this charger as I need conviniance of charging multiple elctornic gadgets.  Though pricy compared to other Chinese made charger, I purchase this because it is trusted brand and look at their confidence when they say 2500dollars if charger caused any issue to our gadgets subject to some conditions this shows how confident they are in their product. With non branded charger I don't want to take chance to my devices.  There is one catch : your charging wire at both ends should be type C only (thin pin) for android device. Otherwise you Need to buy new wire which is competiable with this charger."

'B09GQTTX4N','Stopped working in less than a year','2.0 out of 5 stars','Quickly losing my trust in Belkin as a brand with the last few purchases. The charging speeds of the adapter were pretty good, been using it with Belkin cables as well. However, that doesn’t mean much considering one of the charge ports stopped working in less than a year. It is especially ridiculous considering the adapter was only used very occasionally while traveling.'

'B09GQTTX4N','Belikin can never be a replacement for apple..','1.0 out of 5 stars','If you need a genuine charger then spend money and buy original Apple accessories Belkin is never a replacement for apple..  With in one week, one of the port was not working When i started charging with the other port phone got switched off..'
'B09GQTTX4N','Govind Reddy','5.0 out of 5 stars','It is dual C type port adapter and it supports iPhone fast charging and as well to charge iWatch or AirPods simultaneously with fast charging. Instead of carrying 2 adapters.. you can carry 1 adapter and you can fast charge 2 devices at a time . Adapter is at par with original Apple adapter. It is certified by Apple. Very good for frequent travellers no need to buy expensive Apple dual MagSafe'
