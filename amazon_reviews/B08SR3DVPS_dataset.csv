'B08SR3DVPS','Perfect for shower use too','5.0 out of 5 stars','Wanted to buy a shower chair for my aunt but didnâ€™t want those big and heavy shower medic chairs that we have in our other tow bathrooms for my parents. Wanted something that looked cool a dnd did the job of draining the water. This fit the bill perfectly and looks super cool too. Light and easy to move and can be washed clean easily as well.'
'B08SR3DVPS',"Ikea, didn't expect this",'1.0 out of 5 stars','I was under the impression that I can blindy close my eyes and buy any thing from ikea. Received average product and surely manufacturing check not done at all.  Firstly had to spend a lot of time assembling it and after full assembly annoying to find average, non perfect parts and disassemble and re package to return.  Now I am worried that they may ship similar untested replacement which is defective again, god forbid.'
