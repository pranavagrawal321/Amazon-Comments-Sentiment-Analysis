'B0C33K2PTB','Fresh and Floral, long lasting fragrance‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è','5.0 out of 5 stars','The media could not be loaded. Bella vita ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è To my surprise has been the best purchase so far. Have ordered the fresh variant and I‚Äôm overwhelmed with the performance. At an affordable price of 98, the product delivers more quality. The mild citrus floral fragrance will linger on your skin and underarms for more than 8hrs. It doesn‚Äôt irritate the skin as I have sensitive skin. The bottle is made of plastic. It‚Äôs a clear gel like solution which will not leave any white cast on the skin so you can apply it under your neck, underarms, knees and elbows. It will take 5mins to dry, so may be you will have to wait after application, but this purchase will be worth your buy. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è Go for it !!!! üòç'

'B0C33K2PTB','Use soap water instead, Product is of zero worth','1.0 out of 5 stars','I ordered 4 because price is very economical after discount. But when I used it, this became my worst experience with any roll on. It has almost equal to zero fragrance, sometimes I feel I should use soap water instead.

It has a very mild fresh fragrance that will refresh your mind and also keeps your underarm fresh smelling and controls odor .
