'B01B4PSPHO','Good','5.0 out of 5 stars',"The good thing about the liner is it's applicator which is thin at the start making it easier to apply second good thing about the liner is it's color which is dark enough. The liner isn't smudge proof though but the look which it gives is pretty much matte & not shiny so one can redo the liner if it gets smudge. For me the liner got smudge only from the starting point of my eye beacuse I can't keep my hands to myself and i keep poking my eyes half of the time so if this isn't your case you can definitely go for this product."

'B01B4PSPHO','Will not buy again','3.0 out of 5 stars',"It was my first time using an eye liner sonI thought a pen would be easier.

'B01B4PSPHO','Good long-lasting eyeliner but there is a huge con.','2.0 out of 5 stars','The eyeliner itself is pretty good, smudgeproof and longlasting. But the main problem that this liner has is that not enough product comes to the tip and the liner is not dispensed evenly. The tip just dries up in one stroke and after that I have to shake multiple times to bring the eyeliner out.'
