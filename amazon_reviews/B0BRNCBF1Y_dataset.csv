'B0BRNCBF1Y','Good quality as per the price','4.0 out of 5 stars','I got this for 15k and was a bit skeptical considering ordering furniture from online. But the quality of the product is good when you buy it for 15k the cusion is good and the entire quality is of the product is satisfactory'
'B0BRNCBF1Y','Good spacious and comfort sofa','4.0 out of 5 stars','Looks really great as seen in catalog. Usage: Suitable for 3 seater home with compact space to get occupied.  Only the assembly point of legs require support, which the company can help to easily finish off the setup. Overall, I would definitely say 100% stastified for buying this sofa.'
'B0BRNCBF1Y','Super quality','5.0 out of 5 stars',"The media could not be loaded.

'B0BRNCBF1Y','Excellent Product and Experience: Worth every rupee that you spend on this product','5.0 out of 5 stars','There are two parts to the review 1) Product: Sofa looks premium, feels good to sit on it - Cushioning is perfect blend of hard and soft. Sofa feels sturdy and fabric feels rich. I think overall the product gives you more than the amount you pay  2) and most important Customer Experience: There was a slight hiccup, caused by Amazon "Delhivery" and nothing to do with seller. But the effort "Shahjahan" from Seller side, to resolve this issue (again, wasn\'t even their fault) was execeptional. Since am from Customer Experience background, i really appreciate the effort put in to deliver customer satisfaction. it has indeed given me delight to have bought from this seller.  I think put this two together, you should just go ahead with this product - both from the quality and concern free delivery to your doorstep.'
'B0BRNCBF1Y','Worth the price, beautiful couch','5.0 out of 5 stars','Product is similar as the picture. Itâ€™s beautiful and comfortable. Itâ€™s just that you will have to assemble the four legs yourself. But worth the price.'
