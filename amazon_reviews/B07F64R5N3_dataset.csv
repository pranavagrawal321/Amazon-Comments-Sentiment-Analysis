'B07F64R5N3','Not working','1.0 out of 5 stars','Not charging'
'B07F64R5N3','Not at all worth for money','1.0 out of 5 stars',"It's the very worst Product that I have ever purchased. This exactly worked for 4 weeks and then stopped working. Even the charging cable was of not good quality."
'B07F64R5N3','Been using it for 2 years No problem yet. Only issuue is that it has no charge indicator.','4.0 out of 5 stars',"Great mouse works with good precision and the three modes helps a lot.  I have been using it for 2 years now no problem at all. It got out of my hand and dropped on hard surface too many times but it is quite sturdy and hasn't given any issue to me.  The ergonomic design does prove to be good for my hand, I work on PC almost 10+hrs a day thus the regular mouse was quite a pain in my hand but this design doeas help to not feel any stress in wrist.  There are major two issues that I feel annoyed with. 1. No charge indicator There is no software or hardware which will show you how much charge is left in the mouse. So you'll never no when your mouse is gonna give up on you. It has happened with me many time when there is urgent work on hand and this mouse just died with no warning. I have to keep record of it last full charging date to avoid such circumstances. The battery is quite good after using it extensively for two years and does give you great back up but you won't when it is going to die.  2. It requires rough surface to work on. I am not talking about glass or shiny surfaces like that, I know for working on glass I'll have to buy another one. But this mouse doesn't even work on solid flat surface. The surface need to have some king of roughness to get this mouse working properly, which could be annoying especially when you're not is your office or home. It doesn't even work on plain flat table surface."
'B07F64R5N3','Stopped working in 2 weeks','2.0 out of 5 stars',"Its comfortable to use if you get wrist pain but mine stopped working already. It started switching off when it was kept idle but now even after charging it doesn't work. Better to buy a good quality mouse."

'B07F64R5N3','Not a long lasting item','3.0 out of 5 stars','This mouse stopped working within 11 months from the date of purchase. It hurts to purchase one more in less than a year after spending close to 800 rupees.'
'B07F64R5N3',"This mouse is not at all good it's too noicy never buy this mouse is not worth the money.",'1.0 out of 5 stars',"The media could not be loaded. No it's not worth for money i should have brought different one."
'B07F64R5N3','Good but not great','4.0 out of 5 stars','The mouse takes time to get habitual. But the ergonomics could have been better. The thumb are is in the right location but the bulge above the thumb dent is problematic. Built quality is average but good for the price point. If there is no budget constraint go for an expensive one else this is good. Battery is good Buttons are not silent Do not use without mouse pad'
'B07F64R5N3','Waste of money','1.0 out of 5 stars','Not working with in 2 months of purchase, what should i do with this useless product? Hello Amazon can you replace it or refund me'
'B07F64R5N3','A must buy for anyone with injury or discomfort in hand','5.0 out of 5 stars',"A must-buy for anyone with injury or discomfort in hand. I've already recommended this mouse to others."
'B07F64R5N3','Getting pain white using','1.0 out of 5 stars','Not suggestible'
'B07F64R5N3','Not perfect, but by far the best','5.0 out of 5 stars','If you find the conventional mouse literally painful to hold, welcome to the ergonomic mouse. Also if you hate wires or battery swaps. If the battery dies at a critical time, not to worry. Just use it in the wired mode for a while and it will be charged again. In short, this mouse is everything we have wished for. The only con is that the build quality is not the best, but then the price is rather low.'
'B07F64R5N3','Easy and convenient','5.0 out of 5 stars','The mouse is really ergonomic and as its re. It is really cool to use.'

'B07F64R5N3','Not working within 3 months of purchase','1.0 out of 5 stars',"I purchased this product on 08 April 2022 and within 3 months it stopped working. Though the clicks happen but the mouse pointer wont move. This is a complete waste of money and a Chinese product as well. Don't buy this product if you don't want to throw your money within a few months. There is no option to give a score below 1 and hence giving a score of 1."
'B07F64R5N3','Eliminate your hand and shoulder pain','4.0 out of 5 stars','I use this for my office laptop. Priviously was using an conventional mouse, for 8 to 10 hours for which I use to get a pain in my shoulder area. After working using this my hand and shoulder pain is eliminated. But it takes a 5 to 7 days of time to get used to this mouse.'
'B07F64R5N3','Can stop working at any moment','1.0 out of 5 stars','I received the product and within a day, it stopped working. Buy logitech ergo mouse, a bit expensive but good relief for the wrist. Do not buy this product, can stop working anytime, happened twice.'

'B07F64R5N3','Just no. It is expensive, noisy, and not so ergonomic.','1.0 out of 5 stars',"Everything is low quality about this mouse. Completely not worth 1.5k when better and cheaper alternatives are available. I returned this product and bought iClever ergonomic mouse which is by far the best ergonomic mouse I've ever used."
'B07F64R5N3','Usage experience','3.0 out of 5 stars','The base of the mouse that is in contact with the surface is less compared with a conventional mouse. This is causing difficulty while using the mouse. Also the build and material quality is not upto my expectation. Overall not that satisfied with the product.'
'B07F64R5N3','Right click Button is not working','1.0 out of 5 stars','No catalog or warranty or granty card inside the box'

'B07F64R5N3',"There's no returning back to normal mice again!",'5.0 out of 5 stars',"This requires a bit of time to become comfortable with, especially with the left-clicks being aligned sideways. But once accustomed, maneuvering becomes very easy and feels really natural. There's no going back to the normal device for sure! Have to use it for a longer time to comment on the durability and battery life, but the initial impression is great."
'B07F64R5N3','It is a nice one to use','4.0 out of 5 stars','It is nice and comfortable to use'

'B07F64R5N3','N/A','N/A','great product and price! i use the mouse everyday and have charged it only 2 times so far! been using for a month. also the best part is you could still use the mouse when its charging. definitely recommend.'
'B07F64R5N3','N/A','N/A',"It's as desscribed and super ergonomic. But it takes time to acclimate. Very short, like hours. Give it a few hours and you'll NEVER go back to a standard mouse."
'B07F64R5N3','N/A','N/A','Was having major issues with my wrist as I am at compelled almost 8 hours a day, this mouse eliminated that pain!'
'B07F64R5N3','N/A','N/A','Es bueno funciona bien, la batería dura bastante pero lo que no me gustó es el material de arriba que se rompe de nada'
'B07F64R5N3','N/A','N/A','Broke after 5 weeks.. Very disappointed..'

'B07F64R5N3','N/A','N/A','I have only had this item for one month. I have loved it when using my computer and I hook for the cord into the computer to charge while I"m typing. After only one month it is not working and the cord covering that is attached to the end is fraying and coming off. I\'m trying to return this or get a replacement and I"m not have luck with amazon.'
'B07F64R5N3','N/A','N/A','Used with my computer'
'B07F64R5N3','N/A','N/A',"Says rechargeable but doesn't say when you have to recharge it. When I use this mouse it sometimes it just runs out of battery at random points, so then I have to charge it and wait for a while until I can get back to work."
'B07F64R5N3','N/A','N/A','This mouse feels comfortable but it doesn’t slide very smooth. Other than that, I love it.'
'B07F64R5N3','N/A','N/A','Mouse was good when a worked. But one day it just stopped holding a charge right after the month return window. Shame, it felt good to use.'
'B07F64R5N3','N/A','N/A',"I am so glad I bought this mouse. It's very comfortable, but takes a few hours to get used to if you've never used an ergonomic mouse before. It's very quiet when clicking the left click button, when clicking the middle scroll button it's slightly louder but still nothing like normal mice. The battery lasts me several weeks and I use it for at least 8 hours a day. The different speeds are also very noticeable and convenient."
'B07F64R5N3','N/A','N/A','This was a great mouse until it died this morning. It wasn’t dropped or anything. Worked fine yesterday. I deserve an exchange.'
'B07F64R5N3','N/A','N/A','I have forgotten to charge it for 4 days now. I work 10 hour shifts. I have also forgotten to turn it off. Still has battery! Very comfortable! Please buy it! Carpel tunnel is no joke!'

'B07F64R5N3','N/A','N/A','Edit: downgraded rating from five stars to three. Nine months after I purchased it the mouse wheel started skipping.  I love the rechargeable battery, and the lighter touch buttons. I searched for and thought I was ordering a different product to replace a similar mouse I had but in advertently ordered this, and it’s better.'
'B07F64R5N3','N/A','N/A',"Been using for a week and the hand pain I was having has reduced. One little tip with this is that when the mouse is inactive a left click will reactivate. I didn't see that in the directions, but once I figured that out, all good."
'B07F64R5N3','N/A','N/A','Love this ergonomic wireless mouse!'
