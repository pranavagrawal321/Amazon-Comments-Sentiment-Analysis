'B09GJN9HGQ','Looks good but leaks water','3.0 out of 5 stars',"I was expecting this would be able to absorb water. But the water simply flows down and leaves an even worse mark than a simple ring. For this reason, it can't be used for a very cold glass on a humid day."

'B09GJN9HGQ','Nature friendly coasters!','5.0 out of 5 stars','These are excellent coasters! The initial thing which I liked about this product was packaging! Packed very professionally and very well! It really gives you the feeling of unboxing experience. The shape of these coasters is well designed to hold the cups/mugs perfectly aligned within them. One more merit is they do not require cleaning and even if you drop any liquid, just wipe it or put in running water, no need to wash with detergent and even if stains remain, just treat them as a new design on the coaster :)) The cork material is rough and will not slide or let your mug fall. I liked the touch and feel and also looks premium on your dining table. Priced well on amazon. I would only suggest to not use plastic to wrap the coasters in packaging and wrap with more environment friendly packaging like butter paper, paper etc. I wish the seller/company bring more products with such nature friendly initiatives and doesn’t harm our environment.'
