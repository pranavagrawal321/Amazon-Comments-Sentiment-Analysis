'B07HRTSFYT','Looks same as in the picture','3.0 out of 5 stars',"Just average quality. Not a proper wind cheater, just a polyester jacket. Inner layer is same nylon material as outer layer, it makes the jacket too hot to wear during noon time. You will sweat too much if you wear if in the sun. It dries quickly, and retains no smell even if you sweat wearing it. It is good enough for short rides just as dust protection, that's all. Material is water proof, but the jacket is not. Neck is loose. Elastic at wrists and waists is not tight. It will get loose quickly. I have other jackets also, but they all cost more than this one. For the price, you get a decent jacket."
