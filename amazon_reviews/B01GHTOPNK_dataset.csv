'B01GHTOPNK','top swiss quality','5.0 out of 5 stars','You get what you ask for: top quality knives and a peeler which all really deliver on their promise. As an amateur chef I love cooking. Throughout the last two decades I went through various knives. Expensive ones, cheap ones, name it ... but these victorinox blades are truly priceless!'
'B01GHTOPNK','Excellent Kit','5.0 out of 5 stars','All products in this kit are great quality. Have been using the peeler for a couple of years and it works like new. Ordered this kit when the knife we were using went kaput. Would recommend this as a blind buy for your kitchen.'
'B01GHTOPNK','Perfect in every way','5.0 out of 5 stars','Second purchase of the same set. First was black and this time I bought the red handled set. This time I bought the set as a gift. The peeler and wavy edge knife are really superb and zero maintenance and handle all veggie tasks flawlessly. The utility knife would require honing from time to time, but then thatâ€™s true for any straight edge knife. The three in one set makes a sweet deal too. Red looks better and more like a typical Victorinox knife.'
