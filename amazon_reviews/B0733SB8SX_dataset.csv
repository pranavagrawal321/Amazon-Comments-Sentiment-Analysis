'B0733SB8SX','Taparia Brand is always Reliable','5.0 out of 5 stars',"It is a good tool box both quality wise and size wise. I have many big and small tools and it can hold many small ones exceptionally well. It's weight increases a great deal when filled. Had it been bigger, it will become extremely difficult to carry it."
'B0733SB8SX','Wrong tool box product dimensions','1.0 out of 5 stars','In TAPARIA CTB 1805 Tool box model, they give product dimensions 47L × 22.5W × 22H. But the exact product dimension is 45.5L × 20W ×22H.. They give wrong product dimensions'

'B0733SB8SX','The name Taparia is famous for standard products','5.0 out of 5 stars','Quality matters!! Vey nice product. I bought 2 prices 1 from Taparia and one from another with a price variation of 300-400 rupees. Compared both and the sturdyness and rivetting method of sliding pockets are much better and durable in taparia. After comparison I decided to return the other one and kept Taparia product for me.'

'B0733SB8SX','Very High quality, as expected from Taparia.','5.0 out of 5 stars','Heavy and high quality material, very strong. As expected.'
'B0733SB8SX','Very good heavy duty tool box','5.0 out of 5 stars','Dealer sent this with excellent packing, not a single dent. I am highly satisfied with the material thickness, power coating and construction. Holds a large quantity of my tools.'
'B0733SB8SX','Used product scratches, paint touch ups, uneven surfaces and dents','1.0 out of 5 stars','This is clearly an used piece that I got. It has spots where paint was touched up, paint has scratched off. There are gaps in the arrangement, uneven surfaces and hence certainly not waterproof. I had bought other hand tools from the seller and was satisfied with it, but this one is a rather let down.'
'B0733SB8SX','Amazing','5.0 out of 5 stars','Geniune product'
'B0733SB8SX','Not for good','2.0 out of 5 stars','I notice 2 and more scherrs Riveting not for profit'
'B0733SB8SX','Faulty handle design and fabrication.','2.0 out of 5 stars','Ordered this particular toolbox after going through the reviews and the Taparia name behind the product. Well I was in for a big disappointment this time. Though the package was intact the product was received in damaged condition. May be a lapse on quality check before dispatch. One of the handles arrived in detached condition from the box. That itself is not an issue. Such things may happen during transit. The pipe used for handles is very very light and the fashion in which it has been bent leaves much to be desired. I could have repaired at my end but I am not sure of the period it will last for.. The lifting handle pipes and the tray supports share common rivets and the length of rivets is short as a result the handle was detached. Another thing is the rivets used to facilitate the movement of trays are far too delicate for my liking. Kindly refer the photographs for reference. When someone orders a toolbox this size then ninety nine percent of the time it has to be a technical person hence the supplier has to be extra careful. The way the handles have been fabricated leaves a doubt in mind regarding the genuineness of the toolbox. As regards the finish it is good but what good is finish if I am unable to carry the tool box to the site with confidence? Finally decided to return the toolbox as I am doubtful about the suitability for the intended purpose. By the way I am a site engineer and have been using tool boxes all my life, so I know exactly what I expect from such items. The two stars are for finishing and painting.'
'B0733SB8SX','Sturdy. It is what it looks like.','5.0 out of 5 stars','I bought one that is the same size, the same color and the same design, in Finland. This Indian one is better quality than the Finnish one. Most especially, this one does not have the sharp dangerous corners that the Finnish one has. And this one is cheaper too.'
'B0733SB8SX','Good tool box with multiple shelves.','4.0 out of 5 stars','The quality of sheet used is pretty good compared to other available boxes in market. I personally keep things at full in it... Though it does not sweats at all. The box itself is 5kgs and i keep another 5-7 kgs of tools in it. The price at which it is offered is also good ...but it could have been slightly lowered like 1800Rs would be best for it.'
'B0733SB8SX','Worst product','1.0 out of 5 stars',"While unboxing found handle came out of rivet. One of the tray lid came out from lid. Quality level zero. Don't buy this product from Taparia"
'B0733SB8SX','Not as good as expected from Taparia!','1.0 out of 5 stars','Can not even think that Taparia does not know how to bend a pipe. The handle bent looks worst than a Chinese product. The cost is too high as branded by Taparia. Disappointed. Paint already started peeling off. Attractive colour.'

'B0733SB8SX','Not good at all','1.0 out of 5 stars','This is probably the first time I am rating a Taparia product so low. The product is not at all up to the mark. 1. Firstly it was having some dents. It was pretty clear that they did not happen during the shipping process. 2. There were lot of scratches on the base. 3. The paint job was not at all good. Looked pretty cheap. 4. The handles were not aligned properly. 5. The lid was not opening properly. It was grazing the body every time you open it.  I think they have not put a proper quality control or they have turned to making cheaper products for the online market. Disappointed to say the least.'
'B0733SB8SX','Over price','4.0 out of 5 stars','Decent quality products'
'B0733SB8SX','Good to keep all major tools in one place','4.0 out of 5 stars','I feel it’s little heavy to lift after arranging all the tools inside the box.'
'B0733SB8SX','Value for Money','5.0 out of 5 stars',"No doubt it's a value for money product. As Taparia is known for its no nonsense quality products, this one will also not disappoint the buyers. These kind of boxes are prone for wear and tear over the period of time and I hope it's powder coated paint will last longer than any normal spray paint job. Size is adequate enough but I realized I grew up beyond the league of tool box and will be a new entrant to tool Cabinet because even 30% - 40% of tools on the table didn't fit in the box, leave other power tools aside (no blame the box). Packaging was also good and even attention was paid to add a small styrofoam between it's handle and body otherwise vibration during transportation could have resulted small scratch in that area. One area of concern is that it doesn't have rubber bumpers at bottom but it can be excused as with such load, adhesive based bumper might be just a cosmetic addition and drilling the box for adding screw based bumpers will puncture the case and moisture /water can destroy your precious tools in longer run, so it's something to live with at this moment until Taparia add additional mechanism for the same. While expecting little bit more from the brand, Taparia could have added a thin soft rubber base at the bottom of every campartment. It might raise cost to less than 50 but surely add value to the product because no other brand is offering it. It will just simply reduce the cluttering noise of the tools while hitting the metal body. One last small area of concern is brand sticker, it's couple of mm bigger that the area where it was pasted, Taparia either should change the sticker width or place it somewhere else, or its prone to leave it's surface sooner than expected.  There is no doubt that I will never buy this product again because it seems so sturdy that it will surely last for more than a century..."
'B0733SB8SX','Absolutely the best quality and design','5.0 out of 5 stars','This is absolutely the finest metal toolbox I have purchased. The metal is thick and sturdy, the powder coating paint is excellent and the ergonomics - open / close mechanism are really well engineered with no play or rattle and very smooth. The box was also factory packed in its own carton with superb poly foam protection so that it reached dent and scratch free. Buy this without hesitation as it will last much longer than crack prone plastic boxes and offer you and much better view of your tools. Super happy with this high quality Taparia toolbox 👏🏼 Other brands such as Plantex etc are made with thinner steel so you will not get the same quality as this product if you decide to buy those . Choose wisely !'
'B0733SB8SX','One of the best quality tool box.','5.0 out of 5 stars','The media could not be loaded. One of the best tool box among the other. I got it from offline store for only Rs.1730. Amazon charge it for too much. This makes me price to compare with other window also.'

'B0733SB8SX','Good purchase. quality material and well made','5.0 out of 5 stars','Good packaging. Serves its purpose.. durable and well painted material. A bit heavy , but I thinks that comes with gauge of metal used for the same. Definitely recommend. All tools fitted well. Make sure you use some paper or other plasltic/ paper sheet to cover the box insides as the tools can scrape the paint away.'
