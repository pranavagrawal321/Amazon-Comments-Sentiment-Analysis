'B0BB2LHY8D','Very very flimsy and cheap quality !!!!','1.0 out of 5 stars',"These are a total waste of money . I bought these since they have American Tourister brand backing but I have to say I was shocked at how flimsy and poor quality these are . I bought two since I had to travel overseas - to my horror the zip of one suitcase just have way at the airport only !!! And no they were not overweight or over stuffed - each suitcase weighed 13 kg each - I really wish I had not trusted the brand name - others if you are reading this dint waste your money on this one - it's cheap and poor quality -"

'B0BB2LHY8D','You get what u pay for','4.0 out of 5 stars',"The case isn't as durable as it looks or should be. With even modest handling that you d expect in international air travels, the case bends out of shape easily and looks like something from of a garage sale.
