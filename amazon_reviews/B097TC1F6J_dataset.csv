'B097TC1F6J','silent keys, responsive mouse value for money','5.0 out of 5 stars','I have used many keyboards including MXkeys and mouse including the MX3. But the wireless ones either have issues of battery or sometimes sluggishness.  hence got converted back to the wired connection for my desktop / laptop stand. The keyboard has absolutely silent operation and very responsive. the LED light is a tad bright though. the mouse is very accurate too and doesnt have any lags or start up issues.. and all this at a fraction of cost of the MX series. lets see about the longitivity though.'
