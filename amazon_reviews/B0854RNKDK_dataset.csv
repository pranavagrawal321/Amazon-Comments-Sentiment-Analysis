'B0854RNKDK','Average quality','4.0 out of 5 stars','Decent quality, but not when having guests over. About halfway the tissue drops down into the box and you need to fiddle with your fingers into the box to keep pulling out tissues. Not hygienic... so buy this for personal use only. I bought 2 of the 6 pack, which is packed inside a cardboard box.... but I received only one set of 6. Amazon customer service willingly despatched my another 6 pack as soon as I placed my complaint.... my point is... better buy a single set of these... don‚Äôt order multiples .'
