'B0BM5NVKW2',"It's good!!",'3.0 out of 5 stars','These clogs are comfortable & looks very nice. I ordered the purple one & using it from last 4 months. Plastic is of good quality & fitting was perfect. It is water resisitant but the only problem is, i ordered these for monsoons but it is not at all good for monsoon as it absorbs water & made my feet wet. Water gets inside them.'
'B0BM5NVKW2','Comfortable','5.0 out of 5 stars','The product is very good, light weight & soft. The only strange thing is I ordered size 4 but I received size 3. Then I checked the order details, in description it was 4, but on invoice it was 3. I called the customer care but they were also not in a position to solve this strange issue. I realized that size 4 would be a bit small for my daughter. So I exchanged that with size 6. And thanks to my calculations I received size 5, which I actually wantedüòÉüòÉ'

'B0BM5NVKW2','Good looking and comfortable','4.0 out of 5 stars','Very attractive colour and comfortable. But if walked with in puddles,water enters the base of the clogs...but i guess most clogs are like this,so manageable...I have put a tape on the bottom to block water from seeping in .
