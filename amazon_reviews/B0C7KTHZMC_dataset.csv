'B0C7KTHZMC','N/A','N/A',"Recently we've had a number of big family get togethers and for some reason, no one, ever, brings their phone charger with them. Problem solved. It is also small enough and light enough that it travels well. It is really well made to the point where I challenge any customs agent in any country or any baggage handler from the worst airlines to damage it. HA HA! Good luck with that! They've wrecked hard sided luggage with ease, but the charger made it home alive. Big surprise: the airline denied responsibility for the damaged luggage."

'B0C7KTHZMC','N/A','N/A','I bought two of these units. Did not need them for 6 months but when I went to use them on vacation we found one would could not charge a cell phone.  Investigation using a power monitor found that the good unit could provide 1.8A (perhaps more) at 5V solid. The defective unit does only 0.7A and drops below 4V.  So, your mileage may vary: we got one good one and one garbage one. If we could return for a replacement we would.'
