'B07RWV7JJ7','Quality is ok. But the tape just ok thickness','2.0 out of 5 stars','The side thickness of the total tape should be mentioned. Just mentioning the tape length is i.e 65 meters, no one can measure it. Mention the side circumference thickness of tape only without the cardboard thickness. Mentioning the length is useless as it cannot be measured. Width is ok i.e 3 inches. Thanks to amazon.'

'B07RWV7JJ7','Poor Quality Adhesive Tape','1.0 out of 5 stars',"The media could not be loaded. Tape is flimsy & very thin and it's breaking in between while taking out for use. It is not serving the purpose for which I had bought. It is marked non returnable. As a customer, I will know it's quality (good or bad) only after getting and trying it."
