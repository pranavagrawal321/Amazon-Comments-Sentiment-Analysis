'B0B4N6JVMW','Decent laptop which gets the job done','3.0 out of 5 stars','Bought this laptop 2 days ago and used for normal browsing and watching videos.  Pros:  Fast laptop with no glitch, i had read few reviews about keyboard but didnt find any issue with keyboard. Looks classy although its plastic doesnt look cheap and fairly easy to set up. Good for normal browsing and watching videos, i dont play video games so cant comment on that.  Cons:  Screen is an issue not the best viewing experience, i have to constantly adjust the screen to get all color experience on the website. I thought it might be browser issue and downloaded chrome as well but issue persists.  Battery life is low, without charger cant use for more than 2-3 hours.'

'B0B4N6JVMW','Awesome product','5.0 out of 5 stars',"Very premium product. Got the product at a unbelievable price at Amazon Prime Day sell. Backlit keyboard is the cherry on the cake.
