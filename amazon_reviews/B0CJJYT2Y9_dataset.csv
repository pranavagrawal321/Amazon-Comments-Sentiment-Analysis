'B0CJJYT2Y9','Need inbuilt games','4.0 out of 5 stars','Watch in better in this range. 1. All tracking function working correctly. 2. You can see notification of apps. 3. Battery backup is about 7 day in 20% brightness. 4. IP68 is great in this watch, you can enjoy swimming with wearing this.  Cons. 1. it should be given inbuilt games. 2. Full contact should be shown on phone directory. 3. Other apps like WhatsApp, massage, should be install to read and reply. 4. Hindi fort reading option should be given.'

'B0CJJYT2Y9','A Perfect Smartwatch','5.0 out of 5 stars',"Likes:  1. Good performance hardware 2. No lag till now as promised 3. Bluetooth hardware is latest so it doesn't disconnect itself from phone. Which is very important for a smart device. 4. Strap quality is good. 5. All available features working normal so not found any issue. 6. Battery is running as promised days (with Bluetooth connectivity and Active calling function). 7. Device Full charge in 2 hours which is good for 7-8 days battery life on moderate use.  Dislike:  1. Step counter is not accurate. 2. Sleep tracking is quite accurate. 3. Device doesn't have Screen Lock feature. It can be available on software updates.  This is the review after 15days usage. If I found any issue or update, I will post here. If anyone want to purchase this Fastrack New Limitless FS1 smartwatch should not think twice, Just Go for It."
