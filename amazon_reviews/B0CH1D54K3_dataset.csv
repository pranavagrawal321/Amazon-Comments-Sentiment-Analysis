'B0CH1D54K3','Not value for money','2.0 out of 5 stars','After several months of use find the sofa is unable to hold the shape. The sponge within has deformed now. The fabric used for outside covering is difficult to clean as dust gets stuck in between.'

'B0CH1D54K3','Got damaged product due to improper handling during transportation','4.0 out of 5 stars','Quality of the product, cloth and finishing was really good, but due to poor transportation it got damaged. I got the sofa delivered with one damaged arm(left)'
'B0CH1D54K3','Average product but worst delivery experience','4.0 out of 5 stars',"The product quality is average and as per the price of the same it's ok, will have to see how durable it is. Assembly of the product is also not that easy and may require carpenter assembly. But the delivery experience was worst, the delivery guy was rude, doesn't call you before reaching and calls when they have already reached and kept telling us if you don't come we will not deliver whereas we told him to deliver as someone was available in the house but he did not deliver the product in our house and wanted us to come to the location where he was waiting and when we reached to his location, he did not agree to deliver in our house and kept it at a place 500 metres away from our house and left. Worst delivery experience ever."

'B0CH1D54K3','Yashpal','5.0 out of 5 stars','Good quality sofa.'
'B0CH1D54K3','Durable and decent quality product.','4.0 out of 5 stars','I had purchased this product and been using this for over 4 months. Based on that I am satisfied with the performance of the sofa.  The only down side I feel is the ottoman is very small because of that we cannot claim this as a proper L shape sofa. It is fair to say three seat ter sofa with an extra ottoman.  Rest I am happy with the product considering the price.'
'B0CH1D54K3','Great product under the price range','5.0 out of 5 stars','The media could not be loaded. If you are looking for a sofa set under 20k, then definitely go for this as nothing else comes closer to the quality that this sofa has. Installation was very easy and there is an instruction manual which helps a lot to assemble. Packing was neat and strong but had a smell which needed to be handled. Otherwise this is the best to purchase through online.'
'B0CH1D54K3','Nice look','4.0 out of 5 stars','The Sofa arrived 12 days after booking. Tge packaging was neat and good. The next part is assembly of the legs which is a hard job. I took around 3 hours to fix the legs with the help of other person. The product looks nice. Have to check the durability. I wil surely update if the product misbehaves in the future.'
'B0CH1D54K3','Not a good quality sofa for 16000. Very poor build.','1.0 out of 5 stars',"The media could not be loaded. We ordered the sofa and it was damaged. Packaging was poor plus poor quality material had been used. Also, it took 20+ days for refund in case you get a damaged sofa. You will have to pack it yourself. Many people don't read these policies. So, writing this for your benefit. Better go for Wakefit sofa. This sofa's quality was equal to wakefit's 10000 sofa. I returned this and took Wakefit Napper and it's much better. Also, when the seller arranges a pick-up, the pickup guys never respond. They give different dates and don't come. You will have to spend money from your pocket in case sofa is broken."
'B0CH1D54K3','Worth every penny','5.0 out of 5 stars',"Really loved the product it's amazing just one suggestion may be properly marking the corners with stickers for holes and matching peace will be much more helpful, as I ended up calling my carpenter to getting it installed But product is amazing and looking at prize my very happy very comfortable"
'B0CH1D54K3','Average quality product which meets the purpose','5.0 out of 5 stars','In summary, the product falls within an average quality range and effectively serves its intended purpose. While it may not provide the same level of comfort as more expensive sofas, it fulfills its function adequately. Not sure about the quality of wood used since its fully fabric covered.'

'B0CH1D54K3','Ok for the price','4.0 out of 5 stars','This is not a luxury sofa. Wanted a low costing sofa for my 3 yr temporary accommodation.. Sofa is decent. Comfortable with good stitching . Seems sturdy enough. Hope it lasts fo my required duration as not sure what the internals are. Make note of that this is not a fixed L-shaped sofa. The L part is a separate seating and was disappointed when I got it. The picture donot really show that.'
'B0CH1D54K3','Very nice sofa, comfy Awesome purchase.','5.0 out of 5 stars','I was very skeptical with the color and durability of the sofa. Beyond expectation this sofa has been good. It is more than 6 months now. I am still happy with the purchase. I just have one request to the seller is provide an additional attachment to the sofa to make it as a bed incase any guests come. The attachment can be used as a diwan otherwise.'
