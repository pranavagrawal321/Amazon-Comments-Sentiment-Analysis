'B017PVSRE2','Very comfy woollens!! For winter!','4.0 out of 5 stars',"I have been using these socks form the same company for rhe last 4 years and I kind of forgot that these exist I have been buying woollens from other brands but as I remembered that there is this one I came back and brought these they are really value for money!! 5 pairs for 500 Rs which is kind of doubtful that they might have mixed some other fibres like acrylic or something like other brands but it's okay even if they did the colours can also be a reason to buy them they are very vibrant!! And they are thick Enough to protect you from the freezing cold!! So I would prefer to go for these they are better than other ones!!"

'B017PVSRE2','looks good, feels good, and well worth the price','5.0 out of 5 stars',"There is very little to dislike about this set of colourful socks. They are really very good, and cost a lot less than they look. As some other reviewer has pointed out, a minor complaint could be that the colourful part of the socks is not visible at your ankle unless you hitch up your trouser legs. But that's a minor issue: pull up your trouser legs if you want a blaze of colour at your ankles and shins. Otherwise, the socks are soft, comfortable and definitely value for money. After years of buying drab grey, black and brown socks, I'm very pleased with these."
