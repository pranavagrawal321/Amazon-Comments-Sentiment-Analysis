'B0B46CJ21J','Beware of UEFI Malware installed on motherboard of laptop when it stored in a warehouse.','1.0 out of 5 stars','I purchased a Dell Vostro 3401 laptop online from Amazon 05 Nov 2021. In retrospect after having become wiser about malware, I would not recommend anybody to go for any purchase online. From the day of purchase the speed of the computer was very very slow and it used to hang very often showing error messages. i The biggest problem occurred when it crashed after 6 months and could not boot with the screen showing only the Dell log. Even though it was under warranty Dell said that they could not service the item given the present configuration. After using the laptop for over a year and experiencing over 6 to 7 further crashes, my curiosity made me research online what was the start-up/booting problem with the laptop. Even though the laptop was under warranty when it first crashed Dell declined to service it saying that it was not possible given its present configuration. Probably it had a micro-chip installed on the motherboard when stored in a warehouse in China. This item was one of those laptops imported in bulk from China and had ransomware installed so that BIOS could only run through the microchip which was installed by another party other than Dell. After 6 to 7 crashes the hard disc was damaged. There is no was to get around the UEFI malware. Buying from sources other than authorised dealers entails this risk.'

After starting up the laptop the McAfee anti virus was showing as a trial versiob for 29 days while I paid for a 15 months subscription. I called Dell customer care but they passed me onto McAfee support. I called them but they couldn't solve the problem. Finally after I registered the dell laptop from the dell apps on the laptop, the correct McAfee subscription was reflected. This process should have been clarified more clearly during purchase."

'B0B46CJ21J','Good Laptop but overheating is an issue','4.0 out of 5 stars',"I have been using this laptop for more than a week, and it's a fairly good laptop for personal use. Sleek, compact, and superfast. Battery backup is also very good. The only thing is if you are using the laptop and charging it at the same time, it overheats very fast. I charged it separately and did not face any issue while working. But that can't be a practical solution all the time. So that is an issue. But everything else is perfect."
