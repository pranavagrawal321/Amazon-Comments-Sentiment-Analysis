'B0B46P1CN8','Pure awful experience','1.0 out of 5 stars',"Received this smelly piece of cloth, terrible quality, dirty, absolutely disgusted with it. Never ordering again, can't believe I paid upwards of 1800/- for this. Your local tailor would give you a better bang for your buck without any compromises, didn't have time to go to one, hence ordered. Will be returning for sure."

'B0B46P1CN8','Very poor quality cloth and stitching','2.0 out of 5 stars',"Looks wise it was good and hence did not return. Realised the poor quality in first wash itself, it got torn (pic enclosed) and stich quality is so poor. Nightmare while ironing/pressing it. Misaligned stitching consums too much time and gets double lines while pressing. Don't think will buy the trousers from the pant project"

But when i got in reality its nothing like it.. its hardly strechable and fitting is straight which looks ugly so i returned it back.. while i also discovered an offline brand in reliance trends by the name of "Netplay" there formal pants are way better, affordable price but quality is maintained.
