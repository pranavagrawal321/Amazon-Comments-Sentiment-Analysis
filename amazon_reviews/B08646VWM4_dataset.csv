Title: Discrepancy in Product: Packaging vs. Contents  Review: I recently purchased the All Night Ultra Cover XL pads with great anticipation, as I had heard positive reviews about their absorbency and comfort. However, upon opening the package, I was disappointed to find that the pads inside were the regular-sized ones instead of the advertised ultra cover XL pads.  The packaging prominently displayed the ultra cover XL branding, which led me to believe I was getting a product designed for heavy flow and maximum coverage. Unfortunately, the actual contents didn\'t align with my expectations. The regular-sized pads are not suitable for my needs during heavy flow nights, which is why I specifically opted for the larger size.  This discrepancy between the packaging and the product itself was frustrating, to say the least. It not only wasted my time but also left me without the product I thought I was purchasing. I hope the company addresses this issue to prevent other customers from facing similar disappointments.  I urge potential buyers to carefully inspect the product inside upon purchase, especially if they\'re relying on specific sizing or features. While I can\'t speak to the performance of the All Night Ultra Cover XL pads themselves, I\'m left questioning the credibility of the product\'s packaging accuracy.'
