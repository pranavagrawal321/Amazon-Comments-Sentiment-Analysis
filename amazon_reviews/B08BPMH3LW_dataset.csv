'B08BPMH3LW','Very less durability. Broken within 1 month.','1.0 out of 5 stars','Ordered the product and within 1 moth the rod and mop head got separated. Quality is not very durable. When contacted the customer care, they told I have to buy a new mop head, which costs about 600. Approx 50% of the price. This is very low-quality product. Afterwards, I bought Gala product, which is feels far more durable than this product.  One should prefer standard manufacturers like Gala/Scotch-brite over UPC.'
