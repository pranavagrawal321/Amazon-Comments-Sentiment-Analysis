'B00P93X2H6','QUALITY WORST PRICE GOOD','1.0 out of 5 stars',"I recently purchased the Classmate Notebook with high hopes, as I had previously used another Classmate notebook with glossy finished pages that were incredibly smooth to write on. However, I was sorely disappointed with the quality of the pages in this particular notebook.  First and foremost, it felt like the glossy finish I loved so much was missing. The pages lacked that smoothness that made writing a pleasurable experience. It seemed as though the glossy finish was merely a branding tactic to attract customers, rather than a reflection of the actual quality of the pages. This was truly disappointing, as the smoothness of the pages was one of the main reasons I chose to stick with the Classmate brand.  While the notebook's binding was sturdy and reliable, the poor quality of the pages overshadowed this positive aspect. As someone who heavily relies on the quality of the pages for decision-making, it was disheartening to find that the pages in this notebook fell short. They felt thin and flimsy, and their existence seemed rather meaningless. I expected better from a brand like Classmate, which I had come to associate with higher quality.  Despite these drawbacks, I have not yet replaced the notebook due to its affordable price. I must admit that the notebook's low cost is its only redeeming factor. However, it's important to note that affordability does not justify compromising on quality. I believe that customers should receive a product that lives up to their expectations, both in terms of price and quality.  In conclusion, while the Classmate Notebook's binding was satisfactory, the pages were a major disappointment. The lack of a glossy finish and the poor quality of the pages made writing on them less enjoyable. It almost felt like the branding on the cover was an attempt to sell a subpar product. While the notebook's price might be appealing, it is not worth the compromise on quality. I hope Classmate takes note of this feedback and improves the quality of their pages in future iterations."
