'B0BBND144S','Use only in casino grade atmospheres','2.0 out of 5 stars',"Deal breakers : - the cards get wet just as fast as a normal notebook or a4 paper does. Once its wet, you cannot use it until it dries up (probably few hours). Don't even think about ironing it (with or without cloth), as it would burn right away.  - the cards get dirty extremely fast. I have hosted only 2 poker nights with this deck, the paper has picked up so much dirt that its clearly visible.  I would have returned it right away if I would have used the deck sooner."
