'B08C5P1FVX','Light and soft','4.0 out of 5 stars',"It's light and soft, perfect as an ac blanket, for light chilly evenings and for even as a rug for cold tiled floors. I've used it as a sofa throw. Quality is ok though I'm not sure how it'll stand up to a machine wash. Probably best to hand wash the first time. All in all, at that price its a good buy"
