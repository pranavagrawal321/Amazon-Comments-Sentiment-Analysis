'B08CF2VYB6','Disappointed being a loyal lg customer üëé','1.0 out of 5 stars',"I was a loyal lg customer uptill now, as maximum home appliances in my house is of lg brand , 55inch 4k tv, 43 inch tv, washing machine, refrigerator and many more some of them are even more than10 years older. I was happy with all those products, hence without a second thought i ordered this 27 inch monitor. But the quality of this monitor is very poor, looks like a first copy. It wobbles like anything doesn't stay rigid. Picture quality is not upto the mark. Speaker quality is somewhat ok. And the policy of Amazon is that we cannot return the product only replace. If given a chance i would return it and would go for higher product. Didn't expect it from lg.üëé‚òπÔ∏è"

'B08CF2VYB6','Poor resolution','1.0 out of 5 stars','1. For a size of 27 in, FHD is really poor resolution. Go for better resolution. 2. They don‚Äôt have replace or return option for this.'

'B08CF2VYB6','Picture clarity','5.0 out of 5 stars','Excellent product'
'B08CF2VYB6','Best monitor under the budget','5.0 out of 5 stars','The media could not be loaded. I Used more then 10 days , Best budget monitor and more clarity, there is no leaking white light.And the customer service and response are so fast , You can definitely buy under 10k budget'
'B08CF2VYB6','Poor Quality item','2.0 out of 5 stars','Speakers quality very poor. Overall quality not good.'
'B08CF2VYB6','Good but not best','4.0 out of 5 stars',"The quality of this monitor feels cheap and sound quality is dull even though they are loud but not clear, my 2 watt laptop speakers are more clear than this one. The screen quality is the best, the colors are accurate and feels natural. I didn't see any screen bleeding or dead pixels in my unit. You can control the setting of monitor through the software (can download it form LG website).I don't understand why people are saying that the screen is not tiltable, I can tilt my monitor from 5 to 20 degrees angle. If you plan to use this monitor for coding, avoid buying it because text will appear pixelated at a viewing distance of 40 cm or less. When the window is resize to small, the text is no longer readable. Only full screen with a viewing distance of 60 cm will provide an enjoyable coding experience. For 24 inches choose QHD, and for 27 inches choose UHD. FHD (1920x1080) resolution of 24-inch screen size monitor are only suitable for general use and gaming. Keep in mind that resolution matters as screen size increases; my 14-inch laptop's screen has the same 1920x1080 resolution as this display. Text are more crisp and readable in my laptop than my monitor."
'B08CF2VYB6','Monitor is superb','4.0 out of 5 stars','The resolution is clear, gos sound quality as it has 5w speaker. Overall worth it'

'B08CF2VYB6','Extremely disappointed with its blurry & fuzzy text display','1.0 out of 5 stars','I switched from Dell 24" display to this one expecting bigger & better picture but I had a big disappointment after purchasing this since it has a really bad text & vector images rending, I also called the LG support but unfortunately they said there\'s no problem and its perfectly fine for them, then I gave up and stopped using this display as it started giving me eye strain. I have attached a screenshot to show the difference between this display & other one, its clearly visible but not to LG support :-( I tested the display on Windows 11, Mac Ventura & Linux (Ubuntu 20) all 3 machines & OS, but same result on all devices.'
'B08CF2VYB6','Display is the hero','4.0 out of 5 stars',"I bought it for routine document editing, minimal surfing and reporting. Use is around 3 hours a day. Almost a week of use, I am impressed with crispiness of panel and flicker free appearance. It is having good enough brightness to work with lights on and no issue. Over all build quality is good, stand is bit wobbly. But I am okay with it, as won't be touching or moving my monitor quite frequently. Exceptionally satisfied for screen quality."
'B08CF2VYB6','Excellent','4.0 out of 5 stars',"Main product is good considering the price. Colour accuracy is good enough for consuming daily entertainment. Now come to do the other stuffs. Stands are pretty good but they didn't provide screws or any size guidline. I had to take my hole setup to hardware store for screws."
'B08CF2VYB6','Perfect at this price','4.0 out of 5 stars',"It's perfect monitor for work and editing."
'B08CF2VYB6','Replacement was processed promptly and delivered with promptness','5.0 out of 5 stars','What is very important is how you get serviced when the thing you fear the most happen. I received the product in 1 day. What was very surprising was when I turned on I realise that the screen was broken. A few clicks on Amazon app and uploading 2 photos and a very polite agent immediately processed without any Hassel. A replacement product arrived in less than a week. This time it worked perfectly. Thanks for the prompt service.'
