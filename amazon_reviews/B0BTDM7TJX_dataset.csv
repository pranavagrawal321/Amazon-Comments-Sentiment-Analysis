'B0BTDM7TJX','The white skirt is good','4.0 out of 5 stars','I ordered two skirts from them - white and black. the white one was great, the cloth quality and zipper were good. the black skirt was of bad cloth quality and had a broken zipper. both the skirts were 28 but had different fit. the white fit perfect while as the black was just a bit too small. Love the white skirt'
'B0BTDM7TJX','Very Very Bad replacement item.','1.0 out of 5 stars','The first skirt was of decent quality cloth,the issue was size . So I exchanged it but in return got a very very substandard product. The cloth quality is downright CHEAP. No option on the app to return it.ðŸ˜¡'
