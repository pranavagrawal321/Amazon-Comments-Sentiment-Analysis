'B00G4UB8C4','Awesome deo and value for money','5.0 out of 5 stars',"This is a great deo for school and college guys who are strictly on a budget and I mean under 200 rs ones. It has a premium scent that is perfect for any function. From reading other reviews they said it is not long-lasting, but in my opinion, you can't expect any think more from a 146 rs DEO than smelling good from it!  Well, you can carry it in your bag and reapply it if you think you need more scent."
'B00G4UB8C4','Good product, but terrible packaging!','4.0 out of 5 stars','I ordered this last week hoping that I saved lot of money on this (since the price is too high on the store). The product was good as always. But I find out that the knob is missing on one item. How I am supposed to use that. The package and delivery need to be supervised. Lucky for me that I had a knob left from my previous one.'
