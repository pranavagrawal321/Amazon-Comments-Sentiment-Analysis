'B071SDYY6N','A good for show , Not Good for use','1.0 out of 5 stars','So heavy not balanced, The blade dont match the thinness of the sharp edge. The edge is sharp and thin but as it goes up the blade gets thicker so it doesn‚Äôt go straight down it goes sideways when sliding the veggies. Just good on the eyes flash pretty but no talent. Good for showcasing not for use.'

'B071SDYY6N','High quality steel? No!','2.0 out of 5 stars','I bought this knife, and am used to some german steele knives. The knife arrived and at first glance i knew the quality of the metal extremely lacking, even though it was thoroughly sharpened. I think its steel and aluminium mix, the blade really gets compromised and chipped from the slightest of impacts to even soft surfaces. Save your money and spend on a more durable product.'

'B071SDYY6N','Need improvement in the sharpness.','4.0 out of 5 stars',"Cons:- When first time i got Solimo's chef's knife. It was sharp like razor blade i even injured with the kinfe. After one month of use it has lost its sharpness. It is no longer sharp like it was before. it has got a big chipping by just hitting the wooden board. its is very difficult to sharp as it is a stainless steel knife. Pros:- This knife has a great balancing. The weight distribution is the best. The handle is also good comfortable for hands. The quality should be enhanced a little. Lastly, in such cheap price you cant get a more better knife. worth it should buy."

'B071SDYY6N','Ergonomic, well-balanced, sharp knife','5.0 out of 5 stars',"Found the weight distribution on this knife to be perfect. Handle is an extension of the steel blade riveted properly with plastic grips.  Please learn how to hold a chef's knife correctly. Most people making YouTube review videos of this knife are holding it wrong and wierd. If the weight is not distributed properly in your hand it's not effective. And it may slip and leave you with 9 or 8 fingers!  Also please buy a carbide stone and sharpen every month. Maintenance is required. Even Japanese Sushi masters maintain their knives regularly. Without maintenance the edge becomes dull, that's normal."
