'B0899RLBDR','Not a good sweat absorber','3.0 out of 5 stars','I bought it for running purpose, too big for that. The size is ideal for gym goers. But sweat absorbing capacity is not good. You have to rub it multiple times. So, not a good value for money.'
'B0899RLBDR','Awesome','5.0 out of 5 stars','Size + price + material+ colours... Everything is fantastic.. do not give colour on washing'
'B0899RLBDR','could have been better','1.0 out of 5 stars','It feels very rough on skin... microfiber should be big in size... it gives a feel of polyester touch....'

'B0899RLBDR','The best microfibre hand towels','5.0 out of 5 stars',"I bought these more than a year ago and I must say, they are still as bright, fresh and soft as when I purchased them, despite regular use. Incredibly soft, largeish hand towels, they are the perfect size. Far better than any other brand (eg softspun). No regrets whatsoever. Price is just right.  I wish they made large sized bath/beach towels too. I'd snap them up if they were of the same quality as these hand towels and affordable."
'B0899RLBDR','Superb purchase','5.0 out of 5 stars','Super soft .'

'B0899RLBDR','Good purchase','4.0 out of 5 stars','The product is worthy for the price but its polyester mixed. Its convenient to use one a daily basis. Dries quickly.'
'B0899RLBDR','I‚Äôm fussy about towels','5.0 out of 5 stars','I am very particular about towels and I‚Äôve been unlucky before. The towels I bought before always got hard and rough after 3-4 washed. But these are perfect. I‚Äôm shocked at how low the price is. There is no color loss after wash. The material absorbs sweat and also feels soft and slippery, something that REALLY surprises me. Very very happy to recommend this to fellow gym goers. Don‚Äôt worry, not a paid review, I‚Äôm just happy with the quality.'

'B0899RLBDR','Good Product- No lint- very absorbent','5.0 out of 5 stars','The product images on Amazon looks lighter in colour but the actual product colour is bit bright, deep and shiny.

The dimension is approx 55x 37 cm.  Recommended'
