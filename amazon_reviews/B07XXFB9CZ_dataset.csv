'B07XXFB9CZ','Go for it','5.0 out of 5 stars','I have been using it for a few months now and it is totally worth it. Separate space for shoes, good quality, good sewing. I use it to carry a pair of shoes, and gym clothes and can add a water bottle as well.'
'B07XXFB9CZ','Value for Money!','5.0 out of 5 stars',"You can go for it if you're looking for a decent gym bag. This can store a pair of shoes, couple of hand towels, headphones case and a water bottle for me. A chain on the side stores the keys and other small items. It can also be used for single day trips or day-excursions. All in all, it is a good deal and is a good deal at this price point. Got it for Rs. 390 approx, and it proved as a good deal for me. Looks sturdy enough to last me another 5 years."

'B07XXFB9CZ','Quality matches the value','5.0 out of 5 stars','Definitely, a value-for-money product if your usage is limited.
