'B07RLWMDX5','You may regret ordering this','2.0 out of 5 stars','First of all, I ordered this new soap keeping in mind the Pears Original Glycerine soap. If you like over powering scent of sweet roses, you may like it. Otherwise soap does the foaming and cleansing part fine. No dryness of skin. The fragrance is not as per my liking. Original Pears fans, better stay away. Press Helpful button as Like button.'
