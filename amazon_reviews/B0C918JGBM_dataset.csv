'B0C918JGBM','It’s a great laptop','5.0 out of 5 stars','I will straight away get to the point…buy a COOLING PAD for this pc and an external keyboard and a mouse then it’s perfect. Heating issues are not really major make sure the laptops surrounding (even under side) are ventilated. It’s a great buy for around this price . You can go for it . It can run gta 5 in max settings at 80 gps on average which is great. Many modern games run at 60 fps avg.'

'B0C918JGBM','hehehhehehehehe','5.0 out of 5 stars',"The media could not be loaded. I brought this laptop for 62.5k for 8gb variant but when I received the laptop it was of 16gb 😁. Its speakers are very loud compare to my brothers laptop (vivobook 16x) And screen is also good. No fan sounds.  Free life time Microsoft office subscription and xbox for 1 month and MCAfee (antivirus) for 15months.  Before buying the laptop I read many reviews some are having warranty issue and some people were having heating issues. But when I received the beast I claimed the warranty at once without any issue,  and now about battery issues As this is a gaming laptop, for better performance you should use this always on charging. without charging it will run 2.5 to 3 hr (normal usage) which is good as gaming laptop.  Now its thermals at normal usage are 50° to 55° but while playing heavy games it will not exceed 80° 85° which is good.(at second day of buying)  And one bonus suggestion from my side, while you are playing on battery performance may drop, it may also lag very much. But when you put the charger then it doesn't matter in what graphics you are playing it will give you beast\xa0performance."
'B0C918JGBM','Display quality is worst','1.0 out of 5 stars',"Overall after 1 month use, I can say this is worst laptop at all parameters, display quality is very poor, battery lasts maximum of 2 hours only, don't think about coding in this laptop because it hangs for using visual studio only don't think about other software's. And at most Dell service is very poor, they just want to sell their laptop and don't care about service. So I will recommend don't buy this laptop."

'B0C918JGBM','Gaming Best and a Great Multitasker','4.0 out of 5 stars',"I bought Dell G15 recently and I will tell you why this laptop is worthy of purchase even in 2023 and 2024. I'll highlight pointwise. Speed - The processor is 12 Gen i5 12500H with 45W and 12 cores. I code continuously and work on multiple tabs with high data and memory usage and the laptop handles everything smoothly. The screen refresh rate is a plus in this scenario as well in addition to gaming. Appearance - It has got looks to kill, everyone asks me which is this laptop. Looks superb. Build Quality - It is built to last and can take minor bumps easily. Display - The display quality is debatable for many but personally I like it a lot because it's easy on eyes and I can work whole day on it even in low light with very little to no eye strain. Oled and high res display are better but not for all day coders or gamers like me. Thermals - Many are saying it heats a lot. Yes it heats a lot only when you are gaming for high performance. If you don't turn on G button then it is like any other laptop and stays cool with better battery life as well. Sound - The laptop has sound quality like none other. You have to hear it to believe it. Trust ke you will feel like you are listening to tv or bluetooth speaker. It is that loud and smooth. Weight - The only downside is the weight. I recommend a good bag to carry the laptop as it is heavy. You will get used to it but it is heavy like other gaming laptops. Gameplay - Till now I played Forza 4&5,Battlefield, Fifa, GTA V and all ran smoothly with medium to high setting. Gaming is good but go for 16gb version if you solely want to play games. Else 8gb is enough for heavy work loads and casual gaming. Nvidia RTX3050 is so good, you'll know when you use it. Keyboard and Touchpad - The keys look great with orange back light and are very easy to click so is the touchpad super smooth. Outlets - It has got points for usb type all types, rj45, audio jack, hdmi so no issues. Camera - It is best in class and has good clarity. Finally Dell support and warranty is class leading, I got good warranty cover and support whenever needed with just a mail within their app provided in laptop. I wanted to go for dell latitude but G15 is better bang for buck so I opted for it. Don't worry about amazon they'll deliver it promptly."
'B0C918JGBM',"Battery back up - wrongly mentioned as 6hrs. Actually it's 2 hrs with balanced settings. Heavy",'3.0 out of 5 stars',"Battery backup - wrongly mentioned as 6hrs. Actually it's 2 hrs with balanced settings. Even less with normal settings. Heavy, difficult to carry. Performance is good. Sound quality - volume is quite low. Big power adaptor."
'B0C918JGBM','Best purchase, bit heavy','5.0 out of 5 stars','Best gaming PC, Windows updates are required initially. Alienware CC is best.'
'B0C918JGBM','Worst Decision Ever Going With This Dell G15','2.0 out of 5 stars',"The media could not be loaded. So, Guys my genuine review for this laptop is I was searching for laptop with specifications of I5 12500h with 3050 and I got G15 in ~₹60k and with this price point I thought this is best deal I'm getting compared to Nitro5 and Tuf and till 5-6 Aug Lenovo Tuf was not available so I purchased This. After getting delivery on 6 August I encountered with it's first error at time of System Setup laptop was unable to detect It's battery it was working only on plug in mode. And i was totally frustrated 🥴 with this product after calling service centre and they replaced the battery in next 3-5 working days. And after service it was working fine untill I found one more issue of (blue screen)unexpected error occurred while keeping my pc on sleep. Still figuring out how to fix this. After 10-15 days of use dell showed it's power a black line occured on screen and again service guy came and replaced the whole screen panel and he said it was occured due to wire cut of display cabel I dont know how the hell a wire which is tucked perfectly can be cut. And still I'm facing heat issues software glitches and many more....... One more important message this laptop does not comes with extra ssd slot dell is misguiding us saying they have one extra ssd 2 slot but when I opened the back panel there was no slot at all. Scam by dell saying upgradable ssd slot.  If I just see pros of this laptop its way better than any other under this price whether it is it's performance or playing games doing heavy task it manages everything well. . Sound quality ease of use everything is good. My suggestion is if you are buying this laptop go for Loq or Nitro 5 they are best in segment. Thankyou for reading 🙂"

'B0C918JGBM','Amazing Laptop','5.0 out of 5 stars','Its an amazing laptop for 67k, & Very VFM for 60k (Credit Card discount offer). So wait for card offer and buy, if not in hurry.  The i5 12500h - 12 core CPU is AMAZING.  I\'m mainly using it for design work (Solidworks) & the combination of 12500h & RTX 3050 makes my work easy.  Gaming- using it with LG Ultragear 144hz Monitor -  GTA5, CSGO, Forza H4, are all easy 144fps. Other games need little bit of tweaking to get 144 fps.  Battery - to get most out out of battery, reduce laptop display refresh rate to 60Hz from 120. Google "Windows 11 Processor power management" and Change the setting for "Maximum processor state" -> "on battery" to 50%.  I\'m getting 2.5 hours with basic MS Word, Chrome. You can try turning off nVidia GPU in BIOS to get more out of the battery.  If you mostly use the laptop with AC power, then open "My Dell" app. - click on "Power" in app, set "Battery Charging Mode" to "Always AC".'

But cannot ask more at this price , you can do your daily task and play some AA games as well while connected with charger. Most important thing is it provided ms office 2021 lifetime and McAfee 15months subscription which saves a lot of hassale to get these separately.'
'B0C918JGBM','Laptop Performance is Very fast and Mind Blowing','5.0 out of 5 stars','Namaste Dosto,  Main aaj aapke saath apne naye laptop ka review share karne ke liye yahan hoon, jo mujhe 14 din pehle mila hai. Is laptop ki performance aur features ne mujhe kaafi prabhavit kiya hai.  Laptop ka design sleek aur modern hai, jiske saath-saath build quality bhi khaas hai. Laptop ki performance ki baat karein toh, yeh mind-blowing hai. Maine kai applications ko ek saath chalaya, multitasking kiya, aur performance mein koi kami nahi mehsoos hui. Bade size ke software aur applications ko bhi smoothly run karne mein koi dikkat nahi aayi.  Laptop ke processor aur RAM ki synergy saaf dikh rahi hai. High-end tasks aur heavy software ki processing speed ne mujhe khush kiya. Gaming experience bhi kaafi smooth raha, aur graphics intensive games bhi bina kisi lag ke khel sakte hain.  Laptop ki display quality bhi praiseworthy hai. High-resolution display ke saath, colors vibrant aur crisp dikh rahe hain. Movies dekhne aur photo editing karne mein bhi display kaafi madadgar saabit hua hai.  Laptop ke sound quality acche hain. Powerful speakers ne immersive audio experience diya hai.  Battery life Ki Bat kare to Batary life Average hai full charge hone par yah sirf dhai se teen ghante hi chalta hai  Is laptop ke additional features, jaise ki fast charging, latest connectivity ports, aur user-friendly keyboard, iska overall experience aur bhi better banate hain.  Yadi aap is laptop ko lene ke bare me soch rahe hai to go ahead bas Battery life thoda kam hai baki ka feature bhut achhe hai'
