'B0C3Z81571','Look, comfort and affordable','5.0 out of 5 stars',"This chair has a trendy look. Comfort wise also good. I have been using the chair since couple of days and the ergonomic design let's you work for long hours without break and without any discomfort to back or neck. The product support team is very responsive and cooperative. They contacted me before delivery of the chair and helped me through the entire installation process. During installation I was facing issue to fit the back part so within one day they arranged for carpenter who visited my house and helped to install the chair and explained me the nuances of the usage of the chair. The support team was also continuosly in touch with me post installation and seeked feedback on usage and comfort of the chair. This chair also comes with 3 years onsite warranty. Price wise it very competitive with other brands and I think it's less than some of the other brands. Hence you could definitely give a try to this product for this startup company rather than spending huge amounts on other brands."

'B0C3Z81571','Better late then never.','5.0 out of 5 stars','I am one of those people who for years spent a lot of time sitting at a desk on a daily basis. Recently I felt it was the right time to get a chair that my back would appreciate. With my research and limited understanding, I came across many brands that sell ergonomic chairs. This design had an appeal to it compared to the ones that fell within my budget. (Personal Preference)  Q. So why Vergo? A. Although there are other brands that have the carbon copy design, what I liked is the color for this SKU. Other brands have identical products, but the models have an accent to them. I preferred a solid black. Other brands have identical models in a more affordable price bracket. But the warranty from them is only 1 Year. Whereas here, Vergo is providing 3 Years of warranty. Hence the higher price seemed justified.  Q. Are there any factors that could be improved? A. My build is 5\'7" with my upper and lower body being more or less the same. I found the chair to be really good but a more pronounced Lumbar would have been appreciated.  Q. How is my overall experience with the product/brand? A. Overall my experience is very positive. The item was shipped and delivered sooner than what was shown on the platform. I could not assemble the chair myself as the Allen Key provided with the chair did not slot into the sidearm hexes that screws into the bottom of the seat. However, the assembly is very easy to complete.  I was in touch with the brand POC and was accommodated with a technician visit the next day. The technician was kind enough to provide a spare Allen key that helped solved the issue. I have highlighted the concern with Vergo and I was assured this would not be repeated in future units.  Q. Any suggestions that I would want the brand to implement? A.  (i) The unit did not come with a warranty booklet. I would prefer the brand to include a printed document where it is clarified which part is covered under warranty and its duration. (ii) Basic safety brochure that encourages DOs/DON\'Ts since the item comes with a gas spring & piston. (iii) Safety regulation certificate which states the benchmark that is met by suppliers for their QC tests.  Q. How likely would I recommend this to others? A. Based on the design, appeal, function, price, and warranty window I would say this is a good investment.'
'B0C3Z81571','Great Chair for the Price!','5.0 out of 5 stars',"Vergo Transform is a great chair for the price, even if it may not be perfect.  Pros -  - Very Good overall comfort for long hours - Breathable mesh and seat - Size of seat is big, so bigger people will be comfortable - Lumbar support is 'good' - Looks really good, more expensive than it is. - Base is strong, and wheels roll smoothly.  Cons -  - While lumbar support is good, it could've been better, as the plastic may sometimes dig into your back if you sit at the wrong angle - Neck rest is also 'just fine'  Overall, I am satistfied with the chair for the price, would've given it 4.5/5 starts.  I am not sure if it's possible to get a chair in this price range, that is as good, or better.  I'll also review this on my channel TechReflex, so you can search for its detailed video review there."
