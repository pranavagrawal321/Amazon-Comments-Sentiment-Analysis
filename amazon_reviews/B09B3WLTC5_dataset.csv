'B09B3WLTC5','Poor product and delayed return pick-up such that return window closed','1.0 out of 5 stars','Not only was the product of poor quality - the box had a very strong odor of cardboard and is therefore just not appropriate for storage of clothes - the return was not picked up even though I twice tried to return this product. After twice cancelling the return pick-up, I now understand that since the return window has closed, I will not get a refund. Not only poor quality but equally poor customer service !'

'B09B3WLTC5','Stitching and looks are good','3.0 out of 5 stars','I bought it to store clothes. Detected a smell like cow dung. Was blaming the sachet of camphor for putting dung like substance. On going closer. Realised these storage boxes smell like they’re made from reconstituted cow dung. Maybe they aren’t. Don’t know. Will have to remove them sadly. Can’t store clothes in them at least. Looks wise and sturdiness wise they are good. Sadly the smell spoils it all.'
