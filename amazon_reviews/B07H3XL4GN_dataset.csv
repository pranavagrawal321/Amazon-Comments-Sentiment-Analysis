'B07H3XL4GN','Very good soap','5.0 out of 5 stars',"There's only two types of comments people would feel after using this soap. They'll either like it totally or dislike it totally. I like it very much.  Smell is not that good but almost everything else is good. Creamy, dependable cleaning.  The only con? The soap breaks after two days of non-usage. That's not acceptable for two days of use and non-use. It's understandable when it's almost over. But a new soap? No, it should not crack.  That said, it's such a relief to take bath with this soap. There's a feeling of freshness and vitality."
