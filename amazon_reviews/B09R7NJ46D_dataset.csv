'B09R7NJ46D','Aesthetically pleasing from a distance but nothing much more.','3.0 out of 5 stars',"This review of for the blue / yellow color of the mouse pad.  I got it for my office use as I had also bought a mouse for my laptop along side it, so naturally using a mouse pad seemed like a good option so that the mouse feed does not get dirty and sliding the mouse does not make any noise (as opposed to just using the mouse on the table).  It definitely does fulfill both of those requirements as any other mouse pad would have but I would say it looks simple and elegant from a distance too which is a plus. That's where the upside ends.  For 200 bucks, it is not that bad but note that it only looks like leather (as it has that texture) but feels like cheap rexine. Of course, no one would expect real leather at this price but the feel of this material is below expectations at least in my case. It is just a single-cut piece of rexine.  Thankfully it does not have that weird rexine smell which is a saving grace.  If you are also considering this for simple office use then you can give it a go. Personally, now that I have used it, if I could go back and pick something else, even a pricier option, I would. But then again let's not lose sleep over a 200 rupee mouse pad."
