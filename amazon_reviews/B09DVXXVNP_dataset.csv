'B09DVXXVNP','Premium Lether Pad','4.0 out of 5 stars','The media could not be loaded. This product looks good. It looks like premium. Today I started using. I have to see its durability in longer period. But i felt the item not sticking to the floor but moving along with mouse that should not be the case. The product is looking good. The length of the item is bigger in size. Very elaborative. not much place consuming. It will be good to use by anyone to use mouse at your hime. But before you buy once again please do check the quality of item by reviews especially. Thank you and enjoy the product.'
