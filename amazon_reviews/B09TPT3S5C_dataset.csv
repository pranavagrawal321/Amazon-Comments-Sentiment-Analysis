'B09TPT3S5C','Bad Hair Fall','1.0 out of 5 stars','Caused extreme Hairfall, unimaginable in 2uses.  It smells good, made hair smooth but as said the hairfall was three times the regular hair fall just stressed me out'
'B09TPT3S5C','Effective product','5.0 out of 5 stars',"I recently had the opportunity to try out the Bare Anatomy shampoo, and I must say, I'm impressed! This shampoo comes from a brand that seems to understand the importance of a holistic hair care experience. One of the standout features for me was the fragrance. The scent of the shampoo is delightful, not overpowering, and leaves a subtle freshness in your hair. The shampoo feels incredibly smooth on the hair, making it a pleasure to massage into your scalp. This is particularly important for those with sensitive scalps or hair prone to tangles. I noticed that after using this shampoo, my hair felt noticeably softer and more manageable. Loved the product."
'B09TPT3S5C','disappointment','1.0 out of 5 stars',"Innovist is a disappointment , nothing is hydrating my hair became more frizzy just waste of money full of chemicals and hair hailfall I ain't buying this anymore"
'B09TPT3S5C','A great shampoo and mask duo','5.0 out of 5 stars',"I have dry and frizzy hair and got the smoothing variant. Both shampoo and mask has a powdery fragrance. Unlike other paraben and sulphate free shampoos, the shampoo actually lathers well. I felt it's a bit stripping on it's own, like your hair might feel squeaky clean. If you oil your hair prior then it shouldn't be an issue and it will remove the oil well. Follow this up with a generous amount of the mask and keep it for a while, it makes your hair really smooth. The mask actually does wonders and probably my top pick out of this duo. Will recommend this and I would like to try the anti-frizz variant too."

'B09TPT3S5C','Smells good, but not smoothening','2.0 out of 5 stars','It smells good. Dint help with frizziness, infact made it more frizzy. Maybe because I dint use the same brand conditioner and serum. But I dont think it is worth it, unless they are actually paraben/sulphate free as claimed.'
