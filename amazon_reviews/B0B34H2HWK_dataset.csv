'B0B34H2HWK','unsuitable paper for ball point pens, ink pens, fountain pens, felt point pens.','1.0 out of 5 stars','unsuitable paper for writing with ball point pens, ink pens, fountain pens, felt point pens. Only gel pens work well. Extremely disappointing since this is a set of 3 notebooks, not just one.'

'B0B34H2HWK','Gorgeous!!','5.0 out of 5 stars','I bought the multicoloured ones and they are simply gorgeous. I like colours but with vintage aesthetics and they fit me perfectly. I would have liked them to be a bit smaller but this size is still good. Reminds me of a paperback novel.The delivery was on time and the delivery person was professional. This is definitely a Value for money. Oh, the rounded corners sealed the deal for me.'

'B0B34H2HWK','The cover pictures are not in golden ink as shown in the product image.','2.0 out of 5 stars','Notebooks are decent, paper quality is good. But I was really disappointed to see that the images on the cover are printed in white and are not golden ink as shown in the product images. That was a big let down, the gold pictures would have been really good. The white pictures look ugly frankly, especially looking at what was advertised here.'

'B0B34H2HWK','The quality is good.','4.0 out of 5 stars','The quality of the paper and binding is good and the size too is great. Can easily fit into a bag and not too heavy to carry around. Only one grouse. I wanted one with a typewriter on the cover but got 2 with a camera. For those who do the packing, please make sure the cover illustration are different for each notebook in the gift box.'
'B0B34H2HWK','Best gift','5.0 out of 5 stars','Best product'
'B0B34H2HWK','Not specific.','3.0 out of 5 stars',"The pages are of decent quality, binding is good, over all notebook is great, but the prints on the covers are not exact as in the seller's image, the prints on the covers are on different colours, like the telephone was supposed to be on the green one, but it's on the red on mine, and as I really wanted the quills to be on the blue, but instead they are on the green one, specification gets a zero."

'B0B34H2HWK','Amazing and best üíØüëç','5.0 out of 5 stars','The media could not be loaded. Product is quiet decent but price should be bit low rather than as compared to the no of pages'
'B0B34H2HWK','Expensive, but good.','5.0 out of 5 stars','Expensive for what it essentially is, but good product nonetheless.'
'B0B34H2HWK','Worst product ever.','1.0 out of 5 stars',"Paper Quality is very bad. Moreover you can't return it Back to saler. Overpriced"

'B0B34H2HWK','Very Good quality!!','5.0 out of 5 stars',"Very good quality papers, I really like the feel of it. Can you it with fountain pen. I have used Lamy safari in bold and medium nib with diamine terracotta, which is a very wet ink. No bleed through and a very little show in bold nib. You can use the back side of the paper without problem. Let's see how the binding lasts after some heavy usage. Ill update this after few months."
'B0B34H2HWK','I loved it','5.0 out of 5 stars',"The quality was so good... I bought 9diaries 'cause i loved it"
'B0B34H2HWK','Books are actually nice','4.0 out of 5 stars','Ya, they are nice, but check the size before u buy it, as you are looking for the right one. And can be a little more cheaper'
'B0B34H2HWK','Not what you see in pictures','1.0 out of 5 stars',"You'll likely get all notebooks of same colour, or two of similar colour and one different. Looks like the seller does a pretty sloppy job at packing the right goods.  Bought it at ‚Çπ268 for 3 in a sale and i find the quality of individual notebooks fairly decent at this price point. Of course, in the local market you'll find a much better value for your money but if you are hard pressed to buy offline, you can give these a shot"

Perfect for office/ home use. You get a set of 3 diaries and the price is reasonable. The corners are aesthetically cut with no sharp edges. Loved it.'
