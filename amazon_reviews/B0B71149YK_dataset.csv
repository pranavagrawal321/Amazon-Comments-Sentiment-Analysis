'B0B71149YK','Gteat fragrance soap','3.0 out of 5 stars','I just loved the fragerance of these soaps, and the deal i got on amazon was amazing and the soap really refreshens me. But after using it for a month i have realised that it is not that long lasting. The soap completely get used in a week whereas my other soaps last atleast 10-12 days, hence it is not that long lasting. Overally its a decent soap from park avenue'
