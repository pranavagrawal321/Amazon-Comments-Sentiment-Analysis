Then I tried contacting zebronics customer supporting they are suggesting me to take the monitor to the nearest service centre that is almost 100 to110 km far away from my city .The travel cost and job leave cost me almost the amount of the monitor .what the hell I bought the new pc with 3 years warranty bout I have to spend almost same amount to repair new monitor. I tried contacting the amazon customer support they are suggesting me to email to the zebronics company to provide denial certificate. But I tried contacting zebronics company they are not providing the denial letters .  Poora paisa barbaad banch**  All the money is waste .  I purchased it with my savings to learn something. Now I have learned that not order anything from amazon.  Brothers don't buy from amazon for discount You have to face major problems latter."
