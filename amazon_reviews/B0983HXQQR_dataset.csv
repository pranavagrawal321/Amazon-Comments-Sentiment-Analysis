'B0983HXQQR',"Horrible smell. May make you want to puke. Don't buy if you haven't smelt it before.",'1.0 out of 5 stars','I don\'t know what Yardley were thinking when they made this! Doesn\'t smell anything like any other "Musk" deo or perfume. Of course, I do realize that there might be some people who like this smell, so my only suggestion is don\'t buy it unless you\'ve smelt it first. And just pulling off the cap to smell it won\'t work. You need to squirt a little bit on your wrist and be prepared to gag for several minutes.'
