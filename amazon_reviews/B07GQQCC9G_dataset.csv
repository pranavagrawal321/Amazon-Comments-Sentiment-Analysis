However, powder or whatever coating finish started coming out in 3 weeks. I wish I had known it earlier. It looks so bad to hold after the finish from various parts has come out. It gives a feel of INR- 20 pen."

'B07GQQCC9G','Great Pen, Bad Packaging!','5.0 out of 5 stars',"I bought this as a gift for my girlfriend. It's the best in the market, so obviously, she loved it. However, the packaging was quite disappointing, and the plastic box it came in was damaged upon arrival. Luckily, the pen itself was unscathed.  Things I love about the Cello Carbon ball pen: 1. Silky smooth. Parker and other costlier brands can't hold a candle to this pen when it comes to smoothness and precision. 2. Perfect girth gives it a comfortable grip and helps you write comfortably for longer durations. 3. Little to no smudging of ink allows for a neat and tidy look.  In conclusion, it's a 9/10. I just wish they made a black refill for this pen, and if possible, make one with a click-mechanism so as to avoid the dreaded possibility of the twist-mechanism becoming loose over time."
