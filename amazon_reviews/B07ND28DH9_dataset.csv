Only the minus point is 1 that sky blue liner plastic coated level has fix in name of design. It should also be in cotton design so that in washing time it will not scrach or tore the cloth.

'B07ND28DH9','Comfortable to wear and good value for money','4.0 out of 5 stars',"Feels comfortable to wear. Fits well. Fabric doesn't irritate the skin. The product looks the same as shown in the photos.Design and colors are great too. There's one small problem though, the print starts forming cracks and wearing off after 3-4 washes even after following the washing instructions. Would be great if it remained on without damage for a while longer because the design looks really good before the cracks set in. The cloth material is slightly thinner than I expected but it's fine for its price. Overall a great product for this price range which is why I almost bought all the colours available."
