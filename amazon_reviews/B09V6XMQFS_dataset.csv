'B09V6XMQFS','Silky','5.0 out of 5 stars','Sunsilk was launched in the United Kingdom in 1954. and in the same year it was available in 45 different countries worldwide. At the time, Sunsilk had an advantage over other shampoos in the market as it only needed one application, and so meant washing less natural oils from the hair. Sunsilk cream shampoo for dry hair was launched in 1954.  In 1960, Sunsilk Tonic shampoo was launched, containing the skin healing ingredient Allantoin.  In 1961, Sunsilk Liquid shampoo was re-launched as Sunsilk Beauty, because ‚ÄòLiquid‚Äô in the name, originally was used to distinguish the product from powdered shampoos, and had become meaningless as the majority of shampoos were now in liquid form.  In 1962, Sunsilk was marketed as a range of shampoos for different hair types.  Sunsilk changed their product formula and launched new variants in 1966.  Sunsilk hair spray was first launched in 1964 to enter an expanding hair-spray market, but in 1966 a new product formula was developed. In 1969 Sunsilk shampoo was re-packaged in new PVC bottles.  Sunsilk conditioner was launched in 1971 with three variants for dry, normal and greasy hair. In 1973, Sunsilk launched an aerosol-dispensed setting lotion. An economy size shampoo bottle was introduced for Sunsilk in 1974.  In 1980, the whole Sunsilk range was re-launched with improved formulations and packaging design to regain its brand positioning and brand identity in the market.  In 1985, Sunsilk styling mousse was launched, followed by a conditioning mousse 2 years later.  In 1993, Sunsilk launched a new range of shampoos and conditioners. The "Elida Hair Institute" (a trademark by Seda/Sedal) developed the products in response to the market research.  In 2001, Sunsilk entered into the hair colourant market for Asian-type dark hair. It was launched in India, Pakistan, and Thailand'
