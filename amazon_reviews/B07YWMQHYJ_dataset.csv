'B07YWMQHYJ','Fake product Received - Worst Experience','1.0 out of 5 stars',"The media could not be loaded. I have received this product in March, and I started using it without properly inspecting the contents of the bottle. After four months of usage, I noticed heavy hair fall, which shocked me. I decided to search online and came across some YouTube videos. That's when I planned to check the key ingredients listed on the bottle. To my astonishment, there were no key ingredient details on the bottle, and the content alignment was completely different. It was then that I realized I had received a fake product. I have attached a video of the bottle I received, clearly showing the absence of key ingredient information.  I urge Amazon to take serious action against the vendor. It is essential for people who are considering buying this product to thoroughly check whether it's original or fake by examining the bottle's contents."
'B07YWMQHYJ','Failed!! Does the opposite.','1.0 out of 5 stars','Had good expectation form this product but it does the opposite of what it‚Äôs supposed to do.  After using it thoroughly- it didn‚Äôt succeed in clearing the scalp or removing dandruff even right after wash, but it fires up your entire scalp which will become more itchy.  You can use it for outside floor cleaning or something as fragrance is good.'
