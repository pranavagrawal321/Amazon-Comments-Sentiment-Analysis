'B00LQJ0UHM','Useless hard and annoying','3.0 out of 5 stars',"I can understand that quality comes with price but why did company made something that does nothing but annoying. It is very hard. Feels like made from slippers. It tears the pages apart. Can't erase properly.  Buy less erasers but buy good ones to save your time.
