The installation process was an absolute breeze. With clear instructions and a user-friendly interface, I had the device up and running in no time.  One of the standout features of the Wipro Smart Node is its voice command integration. Being able to control my lights, appliances, and more using simple voice commands has added a new level of convenience to my daily routine. Whether it's adjusting the lighting for different moods or turning off devices without getting up, the voice commands have truly made life easier.  The device's compatibility with various smart home platforms has also impressed me. It seamlessly integrates with my existing smart home ecosystem, allowing me to manage all my devices from a single interface.  The build quality of the Smart Node is top-notch, and it's evident that Wipro has paid attention to both functionality and aesthetics. The sleek design blends well with my home decor.  In conclusion, the Wipro Smart Node device has exceeded my expectations in terms of ease of installation and the efficiency of voice commands.

'B09XHSY1G3','Literally no warranty support','1.0 out of 5 stars','I dont recommend anyone buying any wipro smart product. Its a dark well getting any support from wirpo. No one picks up the call on wipro 1800 number. In most cases the call just disconnects. Even if you are able to connect there is NO action for months together. This organization has just LOST it.'

'B09XHSY1G3','Nice product','4.0 out of 5 stars','I really like th eproduct, easy to install and use. Unlike lot of other reviews there is no disconnect state if power/router goes off. Once router is back online, it cautomatically connects. I am just doubful of quality - for e.g. typicall we use 1mm core wires in our home, this one uses vry thin wire so worried if load increases or lights run for long time will cause any issues.'
'B09XHSY1G3','Good for the price.','4.0 out of 5 stars','It does what is claimed on the box. The soldering on the board is good and the component seems to be of decent quality. But, the wires coming from the box are very thin, I guess they are using this to sense the state of the original switch. Also, I would have preferred if they had used solid-state relays as the mechanical ones might wear out in a few years.'

'B09XHSY1G3','Stopped working after 3 months','2.0 out of 5 stars',"Was easy to install and operate. But now after 3 months it is no longer working. Tried all options but the light on the unit just blinks when powered on. Of course appliances connected to it can be operated manually. But can't be operated thru Alexa or the app. Can't be detected over wifi nor can be reset. Can't even find the manual online. Disappointing especially since it's from a reputed firm like Wipro. Not even sure how to complain since Amazon does not provide for the same except this product review option."
