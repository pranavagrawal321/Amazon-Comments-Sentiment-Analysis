I expected something nice and long lasting for the price, we purchase a product that it should last 2-3 years minimum but here I see I cannot go out or for work with these on(as ads mentioned multiple uses) . It's better that I go for other brands such as Puma or Adidas for this price point. I will never buy again from @blissclub . I wish I could get my money back. Or some solution for it."

'B097XZV3PG','Not worth at this price..its too much for this quality fabric','1.0 out of 5 stars',"I wore it twice and this is the condition of fabric between thighs. It looking rough and small balls are visible on fabric. Blissclub claims they make cloth for every body type but I think it's not good for heavier women. As their thighs get rubbed when they walk so legging get rubbed n become like this..which is also natural. But if blissclub is charging around 2k for legging like this then we expect much more good quality fabric else reduce your price. My experience is okay okay with blissclub. Will go for it next if its around 1k."
