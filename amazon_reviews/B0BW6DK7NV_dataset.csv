'B0BW6DK7NV','Useless!','1.0 out of 5 stars',"Very small...but I already knew that before buying. So make sure you use the viewer or take measurements for your space  Why I am returning it is because as handy as I am, I should not have to purchase a special screwdriver to use the screws for building it. NO SCREWDRIVER is supplied PLUS the holes are way to small for the tip of the screw  About the only thing going for it is the wood!  And they ask you for a 5 ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê review!!! And after speaking with Amazon Customer Service this supplier doesn't even refund!!!  If I could give NEGATIVE 5 ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê I would"
