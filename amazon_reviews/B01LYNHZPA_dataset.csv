'B01LYNHZPA','Shit quality of stitching and fabric.','1.0 out of 5 stars',"The comforter didn't even last a month before stich started coming off and fabric started tearing apart in places."
'B01LYNHZPA','Nice!','4.0 out of 5 stars','It is as it says and does as advertised. The comforter is good and is useful for me at 24 degree centigrade but the filling seems a little rickety. you can already see some gaps in it at the seams. This makes the longivety of the product a bit contentious. As of now it is great and for the price that I got, it is a steal.'

'B01LYNHZPA','Bad','1.0 out of 5 stars','Bad'
'B01LYNHZPA','Not too good','3.0 out of 5 stars',"This is a fairly soft, lightweight and good looking comforter. However, the seams are not well stitched and fray within the first few days of use making it not a very durable piece. It didn't keep me as warm as I would have liked and therefore do not deem the price very fair."

'B01LYNHZPA','Worth the buy','5.0 out of 5 stars',"I have been using it for almost three months now, it's very soft and keeps me warm. It's machine washable. I just put in front load machine(cuz that's what I have) and set it in blanket mode. Washed neatly and dried in shade. The stuffing was retained perfectly in place and did not move to one side. Very happy with the purchase. Worth it."
