'B08FXN3NV2','Bought on 14th Dec 22 and now not working in just 8 months','1.0 out of 5 stars','Purchased the Product (Amazon Brand - Solimo Stainless Steel Insulated Bottle with Flip Lid and Cover, 24 Hours Hot or Cold) on 14th Dec 2022 and it worked fine for 6 months only. Now water is not keeping hot for even half an hour. Bottle becomes so hot that we cant touch or hold it in hand, which probably means the insulation is not working. There seems to be no warranty or I dont know where to go for the complaint or get it repaired if I can.'
'B08FXN3NV2','Worst Product ever','1.0 out of 5 stars',"I recently bought this since its an Amazon brand.. Within few months it lost its retention capacity .. Worst product ever.. I contacted customer care and they said there is no warranty.. So total worst not even one star... Don't be cheated stay away from this worst product"
'B08FXN3NV2','Buy at your own risk','2.0 out of 5 stars',"The bottle has a good finish and quite steady when kept on the table. It keeps the water hot for fairly long hours ( I haven't yet used it for cold beverages). But the problem is with its flip lid which seems to be made of poor quality plastic. When hot water is stored in it, the lid becomes quite hot and emits a bad smell. Part of the smell gets transferred to the water when you pour out the water. Plastic used is definitely not of food grade and in my opinion it is unsafe to drink water from the bottle in the long run."
