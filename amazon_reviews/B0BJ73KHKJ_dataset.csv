Few problems i faced on the connectivity with the phone, other than that the watch is next level. I recently broke the screen of this watch by accident and i require a replacement display for it. If anyone have a knowledge for changing the display from some place in bangalore like a service centre or something. It would be a great help. If anyone knows where i could purchase the display and get it replaced in Bangalore, please reply to this comment. It would be a life-saver. Thank you.'
