No compatible source was found for this media. Ordered with heavy hopes that this can be perfect organisers for home tools but after receiving, i realized that it looks good in picture only. It has made of good quality tin and iron but different compartments are locked with poor rivets screws and that doesnt works properly. Handle is fixed with 2 side small rivets and when you puts tools inside the box it get havier in weight and you cant pick it up and cary from the handle. Handle get seperate from the screw. Also, different comoartment doestnt fit well. Overall product is not worth for this much cost, better to buy an iron made box from a local vebdor.'
'B089N2WJD3','Compact, spacious and strong metal body','5.0 out of 5 stars','Useful product which ia sturdy and can store good number of tools.'
'B089N2WJD3','Its space','2.0 out of 5 stars',"Its rivet is not properly fitted otherwise it's ok"
'B089N2WJD3','Most hopeless thing I have purchased in my life.','1.0 out of 5 stars','The main handle and other door hinges are rivetted. As a result, the doors get jammed and gets damaged while opening the box. In fact when I tried to open the tool-box after unboxing the parcel, the main handle got seperated from the box. I had to repair it in my workshop, replacing the rivets by bolts and nuts of 4mm size.  The manufacturer should be advised to make some other arrangement like small bolts and nuts or a strong and good type of rivetting or welding of the main handle to keep it in fixed standing position at the top of the box.'
