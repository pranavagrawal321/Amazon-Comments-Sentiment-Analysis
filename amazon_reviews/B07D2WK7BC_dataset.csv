'B07D2WK7BC','Not a good buy.','2.0 out of 5 stars',"Am writing after using 1 week. It is not worth of 500 rs. First I thought to return it, but then I gave a try and decided not to return. It doesn't give warmth in normal Bangalore weather also. There is no thickness of the material. Worst part is size is very small. Suitable for only one person. My rating is gone only for smooth ness."

'B07D2WK7BC','Small size','4.0 out of 5 stars','Size is quite small of king size too.I bought king size blanket, but it is not comfortable even for single person'
'B07D2WK7BC','Wrong size','2.0 out of 5 stars','This is single bed blanket and even not for adult.'
'B07D2WK7BC','Product quality is good but wrong specs','3.0 out of 5 stars','I have two products of the same item... One size full Another recently purchased twin size  The full size showed the size of the product as 90 x 90 inches  And the twin size is shown is 60 x 90 inches....  However the size is much smaller than stated.... The twin size when measured is 60 x 79 inches.....  Also in the product description page the difference in size between the two sizes was shown as 2-3 cms.. This is grossly misleading and Amazon should rectify it so that customers could make the right and conscious choice while making the purchase.'
'B07D2WK7BC','Not a bad blanket for one person','4.0 out of 5 stars',"After using for 2 months i am writing this review. Quality is good. Color is good. Comfort is perfect. Warmth is perfect for Indian climate. SIZE is an issue it's not a double blanket. Only for a one person it's perfect."
'B07D2WK7BC','Size and s small','5.0 out of 5 stars','Lovely product. However size is a bit small for the price. I ordered another one which is queen size , and found out that the size is bigger . The twin size should be advertised as single and not twin .'
'B07D2WK7BC','Go for it!!','5.0 out of 5 stars','Amazingly smooth and feels like you are covered with clouds. Not preferable for tall people (>6feet) or double bed. Its for single person use only but worth it!'
'B07D2WK7BC','Misleading reviews','2.0 out of 5 stars','Bohot sare review dekh kr ye 3 blanket order kiye the humne.1st use k baad hi feel hua ye AC comforter se jyada kuch nhi hai.sardiyon k liye iska koi use nhi,size bhi choti hai.1000 me milne wale mink blankets is product se kafi behtar hai.'

'B07D2WK7BC','Soft and cozy blanket for mild winters','4.0 out of 5 stars','I moved to a new place earlier this year and ordered this blanket after the night temperatures at my place in Punjab started going down to 20 degrees celsius. It just fits the bill. Important points to keep the review short- 1. This is a blanket for mild winters. Like those of November and February in North India. 2. The blanket is light-weight, very soft, and cozy. 3. The fabric is not allergic. I was never able to use a blanket without a cotton cover but I am comfortable with these even without a cover. 4. The fabric quality is premium and it feels that the blanket will last for long. 5. The look is elegant. I mean really elegant. 6. The only con is that the length of the blanket is a bit shorter than market standard. If your height is more than 5 feet 10 inches, this blanket is not for you.'

'B07D2WK7BC','Wastage of money.','1.0 out of 5 stars','Quality is not good as it is made in china. Very thin. Warmth and comfort is not for winter but only for AC rooms with 26 degree Celcious temperature settings. The same quality is available at price 400/- in local market. I returned'
