'B0B65NQDXW','A bit crudely made,','2.0 out of 5 stars','Useful for A4 size papers. Legal papers are bigger. The size mentioned is for the outer border, including beading, which makes the inner space smaller. Therefore B4 size paper edges will bend and crumple inside.'
'B0B65NQDXW','Misleading representation','2.0 out of 5 stars','In photo shown 5 pcs but actually it is 2 pcs.'
'B0B65NQDXW','Not as per product description','1.0 out of 5 stars','Very bad performance'
'B0B65NQDXW','3x overpriced','2.0 out of 5 stars','This item is highly overpriced. I bought 2 folders for 299. Few daya later found same dolder for rs 56 each at corner stationary shop. Not worth the money.'
'B0B65NQDXW','Misleading picture','3.0 out of 5 stars',"Picture shows 5 folders, but you are actually buying only 2 folders.  It says 2 in the Description but your focus is on the picture, which shows 5 folders.  It's too costly for 2 folders."
'B0B65NQDXW','Good','4.0 out of 5 stars','Good'
'B0B65NQDXW','Size too small for full scap papers.','1.0 out of 5 stars',"It is a complete waste of money. Legal size papers don't fit into these folders. Also very slim. So just a few sheets of A4 size papers can go in. Definitely not value for money. Can't say about durability as I cannot use it."
'B0B65NQDXW','Value for money','3.0 out of 5 stars','Ok quality good and fit to size'
