'B076BML12K','Comfortable for temperature from20degree and above','5.0 out of 5 stars','super soft and comfortable. Good for Kerala nights which are cold in monsoons and rainy nights. This is double bed size .  Editing the review to share washing method : Wash in semi automatic washing machine and rinse it the same tub by putting fresh water . Remove water from tub , let the water go out from the blanket . Do not put the blanket in spin tub - it won‚Äôt fit . Put it out to dry .  Ofcourse , it‚Äôs easier to wash in fully automatic machine but it won‚Äôt require full cycle . Handle with care for long lasting use .'
