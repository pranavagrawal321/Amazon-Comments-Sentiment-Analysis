Oxo-film is often falsely marketed as being biodegradable, when it is only degradable.  ‚ÄúDegradable‚Äù cutlery is made from a blend of bio-additives, such as starch (PSM ‚Äì Plant Starch Material, for example), and traditional plastics such as polypropylene (PP) and polystyrene (PS). These blends often consist of 70% plastic! This cutlery is NOT compostable or biodegradable.  The 70% plastics remains (in form of micro plastics) after the decomposition of 30% starch.'

'B08TDH2LCP','Good but not strong enough','3.0 out of 5 stars',"I have been ordering biodegradable garbage bags since some time. This time I went with Presto instead as my usual one was not deliverable.
