'B07FYSXPT1','N/A','N/A','So comfortable and way better than more expensive brands, IMO.'
'B07FYSXPT1','N/A','N/A','I previously ordered a queen sized pillow, and was very happy with the quality. However, the standard sized pillow is of extremely poor quality. It’s the size of a throw pillow, and is basically a little fluff in a paper liner.'
'B07FYSXPT1','N/A','N/A','These pillows are constructed well. They are comfortable, although after using for a couple of months they have begun to loose its shape where my head lays. This is disappointing. I was hoping it would last a longer'
'B07FYSXPT1','N/A','N/A','I am so thankful you could take stuffing out. It’s not a cool pillow that’s for sure. I wouldn’t purchase this product again.'
'B07FYSXPT1','N/A','N/A','I am a side sleeper and I find it hard to find a pillow that is the right height for me to keep my head in alignment with my spine. This pillow does it. It is soft and comfortable and keeps my neck in line with my spine..'
'B07FYSXPT1','N/A','N/A','Comfy pillows but not what I was looking for. Which is my fault but the are comfy and help with over heating.'
'B07FYSXPT1','N/A','N/A',"My husband has had a horrible pillow for years. Doesn't want it too puffy or it hurts his neck. Would not give it up. I took a few minutes to pull out a lot of the filling in the new pillow, put it in a new waterproof pillowcase and he has been using it for about 5 days. He is so happy and so am I. It's surprisingly heavy. The zipper is just a few inches long. At first I thought it was sewn wrong into the pillow because it doesn't have a little piece to grab (or poke you). It was also packed in a heavy plastic bag so it couldn't pick up any little hitchhikers along the way to us. I still throw it in a hot dryer for at least 10 minutes to be safe. I had read it helps to keep bedbugs away. Anyhow, I now have a happy, pain free husband, a clean new pillow (2 come in the pack) and enough extra filling to make a couple pillows for some chairs."
'B07FYSXPT1','N/A','N/A','Arrives compressed, but fluffs up as soon as package is opened. Very comfortable, re-fluffs after lightly compressed from sleeping. Zipper can be opened if you want to remove some of the fill (I didn’t need to).'
'B07FYSXPT1','N/A','N/A','Adjustable fill pillow. Very nice product.'
'B07FYSXPT1','N/A','N/A','My product was clear used and not new. It had been repackaged in a box someone had previously used for moving, marked "Mom\'s Stuff"'
'B07FYSXPT1','N/A','N/A','Firm, stiff, heavy, not comfortable. I regret this purchase'
'B07FYSXPT1','N/A','N/A','I was excited to try this pillow but it is extremely firm and not anywhere close to what I expected as a “down alternative” pillow.'
'B07FYSXPT1','N/A','N/A','I expected a comfortable pillow (two, actually), and was highly disappointed. They are hard as rocks.'
'B07FYSXPT1','N/A','N/A','The down alternative is polyester…and what does polyester do…traps in heat. The pillow was so warm to lay your head on…I had to immediately remove them from the bed and return to my true down pillows.'
'B07FYSXPT1','N/A','N/A','I’ve ordered pillows online before, I expected them to come in a vacuum sealed bag. I left the pillows out to fluff up and that moment never came. I even tossed them in the dryer on air fluff and nada. I own the COOP Pillows that I love, I expected these to be similar considering you can customize them. Oh that’s right, I like many others, did not receive any additional balls to fluff them more. If you’re on the fence about them, just go ahead and climb over it and continue your search.'
'B07FYSXPT1','N/A','N/A','Just used them for the first time - really like them!! Great Buy!'
'B07FYSXPT1','N/A','N/A','This standard size pillow is made so well, I bought one for each of my bedrooms for guests, and also one for each of us.'
'B07FYSXPT1','N/A','N/A',"These pillows are flat, hard, and don't provide support for side sleepers"
'B07FYSXPT1','N/A','N/A','This product was nice in the beginning, but a couple months later it fell apart. Zipper broke and stuffing poured out making a mess! Tossed pillows in garbage! Ugh'
'B07FYSXPT1','N/A','N/A','Comes with a very small cheap plastic zipper with no attachment so difficult to use. Zipper came undone which resulted in an unusable pillow.'
'B07FYSXPT1','N/A','N/A','“Filling inside was “ loose filler” inside can cause sneezing....From China'
'B07FYSXPT1','N/A','N/A',"These pillows are super comfortable. Smoosh them, fluff them, steal the filling from one to boost the other - you've got your own customizable set to make just how you like. The cover is soft as well and I've slept better in the past two months with these than I have in a long time. They are great for a side sleeper - no neck pain!"
'B07FYSXPT1','N/A','N/A','I took one of these for myself and gave one to my old man. Three months later, they are still holding up very well. We are both side sleepers and have never had to even fluff them up.'
'B07FYSXPT1','N/A','N/A','Needed some new bed pillows and these fit the bill. Comfy, soft, fluffy - just what I wanted and needed.'
'B07FYSXPT1','N/A','N/A','I got a set of two and they were so flat that I had to remove the stuffing out of one to put in the other. So I basically only got one pillow. I do like it now that I’ve done that though.'
'B07FYSXPT1','N/A','N/A','Me agrado mucho la almohada, no es ni muy suave ni muy dura, probablemente lo sea para algunas personas pero para mi es perfecta, lastima que Amazon descontinua estos productos muy rápidamente :('
'B07FYSXPT1','N/A','N/A','These are comfy pillows that have kept their shape for a while. They don’t make me sweat which is important for me. They’re on the form side, so they work great as a secondary pillow or side sleeper (like me). I only use one, so there’s an extra one just waiting to be used. Worth the price compared to other retailers.'
'B07FYSXPT1','N/A','N/A','I am delighted to have found these customizable pillows. I was able to adjust them to the perfect thickness to avoid neck kinks and any other discomfort.'
'B07FYSXPT1','N/A','N/A','Best pillows ever and we have tried them all from sealy & serta & store brand  These are the most comfortable for both back & side sleepers'
'B07FYSXPT1','N/A','N/A','These are amazing! So comfy.'
'B07FYSXPT1','N/A','N/A','Great product. Makes a great positive difference'
'B07FYSXPT1','N/A','N/A','Okay, I have been using these pillows nightly for 8 months now. Still as comfortable as the day I got them. Once I found out how soft I wanted them and adjusted them accordingly, I was set. Eight months later they are still the same softness as the day I stuffed them (yes, you adjust the stuffing to your likeness). I am very pleased that I skipped the $49 My Pillow and opted for these instead. Should they flatten a bit in the future, I have plenty of stuffing left over to add some.'
'B07FYSXPT1','N/A','N/A','Love, love these pillows. I washed the whole pillow stuffing and all. They are super stuffed, I was looking for something soft and low profile so I removed like three gallon baggies out of one pillow and saved it. The stuffing is so soft and comfy! Buy them!!'
'B07FYSXPT1','N/A','N/A','My favorite part about these pillows is that you can defluff or put extra fluff as needed.'
'B07FYSXPT1','N/A','N/A','Since this item is sold under AMAZON BASICS one would expect product to be as advertised. Not the case here ! Pillows arrived today. Returning them right away! Supposed to be filled with poly fiber "balls". Instead just shredded fiber. Extra bag of "balls" did not come as promised. Zippers have no pull so difficult to open. When I did get it open the stuffing got caught up in the zipper making it difficult to close! Don\'t waste your money!'
