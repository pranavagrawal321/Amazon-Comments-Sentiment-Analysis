'B0BQMVTNN2','Right flare, beautiful look','4.0 out of 5 stars','The skirt has perfect flare, just enough to look like a lehanga. It looks beautiful with a traditional crop top. The only issue is, since the material is weaved with golden zari, it is little itchy on its belt. May be an underlying cloth on the belt can be a quick fix.'

'B0BQMVTNN2','Worth buying!!','5.0 out of 5 stars','I purchased the maroon ethnic skirt for my wife. It is so beautiful. Value for money. The fabric gives it a rich look. It can be worn with a crop top or a blouse like lehenga. I am happy with the purchase. My wife is 5\'2" so it\'s bit long for her even with 2.5 inch heel. It can fit upto 38" waist comfortably.'
