'B07R48C6WT','Good','5.0 out of 5 stars',"I'm using it from 1 week now. It's very good. It smelt like little pears soap. Actually I don't care about smell less is better for me. It makes less lather If you use loofah then it makes too much lather. I personally loved the feel. I live in area that provide hard water(bore water) for bath it works in great in that too doesn't make my skin dry. My skin is smooth and never been better. When this pack will end I'll think of buying again. And important thing is it's affordable and reasonable price. Thanks amazon."
