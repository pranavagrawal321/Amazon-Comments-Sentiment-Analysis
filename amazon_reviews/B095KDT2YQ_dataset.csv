'B095KDT2YQ','Great for taking annotated notes','5.0 out of 5 stars','This notebook, being checkered, helps in taking properly formatted notes. I can allocate the space to write down the notes and space to annotate it, write down the thoughts and questions. Great cover quality, Page quality'
'B095KDT2YQ','Found a new brand to fangirl about ‚ú®','5.0 out of 5 stars',"The paper quality and hardcover is SO GOOD. The additional pocket in the back and the bookmark are cool too. The fact that it's length is way more than width (like a phone) only adds to the overall aesthetic. SUPER AWESOME. 10/10 recommend."

'B095KDT2YQ','Not satisfactory','1.0 out of 5 stars','A view of the actual is different to purchage'
'B095KDT2YQ','Worth the price','5.0 out of 5 stars',"Honestly at this price this is a steal. The overall quality of the journal is absolutely amazing. It got a clothbound textured hard covering. The paper quality is good and could be used for gouache paintings aswell, the paper might wrinkle a little but it'll be okay once it dries out. You can use it for several purposes. Some gel pens might get imprinted on the other side so i would recommend using a ball point pen, and avoid using sketch pens and markers. It also come with a small compartment at the end of the journal for storing documents aswell. Totally worth the price."

'B095KDT2YQ','Fair binding , good quality paper','4.0 out of 5 stars','This book is neatly made and bound. It has a precision cut and binding . The hardcover is Matt textured and the internal pages are smooth and probably 90GSM. Sadly the second book i purchased was not really the color as pictured which is a light Tan Brown.
