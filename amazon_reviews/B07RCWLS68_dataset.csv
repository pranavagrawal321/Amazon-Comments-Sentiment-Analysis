'B07RCWLS68',"It's just FOAM...",'2.0 out of 5 stars','After looking at images given, we were under impression of mattress fitted inside... After opening the product we realised that there is EPE foam sheet inside.. which is normally used in packaging..with thin layer of sponge on one side and thin sheet of felt fabric mostly.. Did not like the covering sheet either.. not worth the price at all..'
'B07RCWLS68','I like dis product. has an elegant design','5.0 out of 5 stars','I like this product it has a very elegant look and 4 √ó 6 size is perfectly alright its also very lightweight so it a helps you in moving around your house even a 10 yr old can move it without affort.'

'B07RCWLS68','Light Weight','5.0 out of 5 stars','If you are looking for a comfortable bed then go for this product. Two person can sleep on this easily and around 3 medium sized people can sit on it when turned to sofa. Brand warrenty by Coir Fit. Single person can fold and unfold it. It is very light in weight.  Only problem is that when you wash the cover it will be tough to fir the foam inside again, and if cover gets any stain or ripped then this sofa will be of no use.'

'B07RCWLS68','recommended to buy if the requirement is for space saving','5.0 out of 5 stars','I bought 2 of these mattress/sofa, I am quite happy with the quality and sturdy bedding gave quite support to the back and looks reliable, only suggestion is that the cover seems to be little off as the fabric already start to wear out'
'B07RCWLS68','No way it is a quality product !','1.0 out of 5 stars',"Bought seeing on a sale under 5K. By going thru the reviews, i found it's not what i wanted. Cancelled it. But still delivered ! It is just a jute cover stuffed with some plastic stuffing material. It is hard. One side they have kept a cushion and other side some floor mat kind of material. You cant bend much if you're using that as sofa ! I am not talking only about this particular brand. Any brand would be 'something like this' only. Avoid it if you're looking for a quality product. back rest is small even for a 2nd standard kid (for sofa)."
