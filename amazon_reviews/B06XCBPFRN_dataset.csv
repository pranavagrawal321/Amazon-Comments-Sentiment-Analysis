'B06XCBPFRN','Good','5.0 out of 5 stars','The STANLEY STST1-80151 toolbox is a practical and versatile storage solution. Its durable construction ensures longevity, while the ample storage space accommodates various tools. The removable tray adds to its functionality. However, the latch mechanism could be more secure. Overall, a reliable toolbox for light to medium tool organization needs.'

'B06XCBPFRN','QUALITY AND SPACE AVAILABILITY','5.0 out of 5 stars','This is indeed an excellent thing as a product manufactured by STANLEY. Very very useful and spacious too, but little delicates. And must be handled with care and pamper. I bougjt one and very happy with the product.'

'B06XCBPFRN','May be better','3.0 out of 5 stars','The lock could have been sturdier. The plastics can be even tougher with the regard to the size.'
'B06XCBPFRN','Is it an original STANLEY product?','3.0 out of 5 stars','I‚Äôm strongly doubtful whether it‚Äôs an original STANLEY product! It‚Äôs all fixed with stickers that too unaligned!!!! I have other products of STANLEY. But this tool box,,,,, I‚Äôm not convinced about it‚Äôs authenticity! Moreover the first one I received was a broken lock! However it was replaced. Very doubtful about its authenticity!!!!!!!'
'B06XCBPFRN','Only for light weight tasks','2.0 out of 5 stars','The plastics on these are absolutely basic and cracks appear on it eventually.  The plastic hinges are low quality and better replaced with sturdier plastics or with metal parts.  Would advice people to go for the Dewalts from the same company as I found them excellent.'
'B06XCBPFRN','Super product 100% genuine','5.0 out of 5 stars','Amazing product amazing amazon'
'B06XCBPFRN','Not so sturdy','2.0 out of 5 stars','When unpacking we discovered that one of the hinges from the small lid on top had been broken off. Today one of the larger hinges came off and was very difficult to put back. Overall sturdiness is low, The three separate boxes are alright and big enough to store your tools and machinery. No value for money. Better buy a steel toolbox. One good thing though, you can sit on it or use it as a step.'
'B06XCBPFRN','Not durable at all','1.0 out of 5 stars','The hinge mechanism of first box of 3 got damaged as started using the tool box.. if you open the lid completely then while closing it, plastic hinge gets ruptured,that how it cuts all the hinges.. don‚Äôt buy it‚Ä¶'
'B06XCBPFRN','Well designed, not so sure about the strength','4.0 out of 5 stars','Looks good. Well designed. Definitely carries a lot. However, not so sure about the strength as to how it will take a few knocks or even a small drop. Guess only time will tell.'

'B06XCBPFRN','The 4 clips holding the 3 compartments should have been made in metal. These clips keep coming off.','4.0 out of 5 stars','The plastic clips on the side, which hold the 3 different compartments together, should have been made in metal. Not plastic, these keep coming off and have to be attached again. Apart from this everything else is good.'

'B06XCBPFRN','Great value for money with amazing convenience','5.0 out of 5 stars','Light weight, modular, easy to stack, convenient handling'
'B06XCBPFRN','The wheels are bad and were not needed..should have had a trolley instead','4.0 out of 5 stars','The media could not be loaded. This is a fantastic product with lots of storage and you can plan out well ..just dont store lighter items below and heavy above(obvious reasons) I use it indoors. Just plan it this way easy and daily access on the top and graduate down the usage frequency to the lowest bin..  A few hickups like the top bin yellow flaps are a bit loose  This looses 1 star for... The lower section loses a lot of storage space due to the wheel which is of no use ( my thoughts) as an extensive user and as I use it "indoors only" my specific usage is much better served with the wheeled trolley that I made out of a board and wheels...  Overall I love it'
'B06XCBPFRN','Missing lid. Broken Pivot','3.0 out of 5 stars','I was not in town when the parcel arrived.... opened it only to find the lid on one of the storage areas missing... there is remains of the pivot pin. images attached.'
'B06XCBPFRN','Perfect for all home improvement tools.','5.0 out of 5 stars','This is perfect storage for all home improvement tools. Can easily carry it wherever you want especially if you have more than one house or farmhouse and like to tinker around. Very spacious and sturdy. I am very happy with mine. Good value for money.'
'B06XCBPFRN','Looks good and seems VFM','4.0 out of 5 stars','The pricing being so attractive, got it but the outer box was supposedly damaged so they shipped it with just a plastic cover. It was intact inside on checking, so took delivery. Normally I‚Äôd refuse. Coming to the top box, it‚Äôs quite deep with metal lickings. Yellow part is disappointing with not much space and is only there for glamour. Last box is good. Side locks are all plastic. Wonder if they will last. Wanted the plastic overall to be thicker and more rugged. Plastic Wheels are just about functional. Not sure if they can carry any weight. No info booklet was inside. Lugging handle has to be first locked in place else it‚Äôs useless. So many compromises for attractive price! Using it for now. What to do? No other competitive product can match this right now. And Stanley is a brand. Bland and yellow combination looks good. That‚Äôs all'

'B06XCBPFRN','Value for money','5.0 out of 5 stars','Recommended for home use, small companies can use for weight less tools not recommended for heavy tools and rough usage'
'B06XCBPFRN','Good Buy','3.0 out of 5 stars','Product is nice, very useful for commercial use. Huge in size. But actual MRP printed on the box is Rs.4350/-. Not Rs. 8700/-.After so many complaints to vendor & Amazon, MRP updated on 3/9/21 which is also not correct.'
