'B0846FQF4Y','Good quality bag but locking issues','3.0 out of 5 stars',"I purchased this bag last year and travelled twice until now and at both occasions, I faced issues with lock. I use same combinations for all my bags so it's unlikely that I used a different combination. Had to wait for couple of days and after attempts, I could somehow unlock it. And this was repeated again. Bought a TSA lock as inbuilt locking system is highly unreliable. Otherwise bag is spacious, durable, looks nice and have no other problem."
