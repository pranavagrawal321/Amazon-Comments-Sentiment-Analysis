'B07JJCJG5W','A delicate bag for light stuff','2.0 out of 5 stars','This bag is flimsy, not stiff at all Meant only for storing light material; Not at all sturdy. Overstuffing will tear it from the stitching if u store heavy stuff and pull it from the Handles, it will be torn apart. Bag has a good storage capacity'
'B07JJCJG5W','Not good as expected','1.0 out of 5 stars','Collopcible material.ordinary cloth fabric Cannot keep dirt away.it is okay protect. We can keep big blanket.Spacious.but we can try more better one.'
'B07JJCJG5W','No sturdiness. Just like a rectangular bag without base & side stiffening.','3.0 out of 5 stars','Manufacturer must develop it as an alternative to IKEA Skubb rectangular clothing case , having sufficient stiffing.'
'B07JJCJG5W','Not having metal frame','3.0 out of 5 stars','Returned the product as not having metal wire frame'
'B07JJCJG5W','Spacious','5.0 out of 5 stars','Size is good enough. Not much sturdy. But good to use.'
'B07JJCJG5W','No','2.0 out of 5 stars','Ok'
'B07JJCJG5W','Size misled','4.0 out of 5 stars','Nice but too big. Size misled'
'B07JJCJG5W','N/A','N/A',"Per la mia esigenza lo ritengo un oggetto ben fatto ed abbastanza resistente (chiaramente il tempo e l'uso potranno confermare la prima impressione). Dimensioni ottimale per un piumone matrimoniale non troppo voluminoso oppure per 3/4 coperte o plaid singoli. La trasparenza aiuta a vederne il contenuto anche se riposto sopra un armadio, maniglie utili alla presa. Ben fatto."
'B07JJCJG5W','N/A','N/A',"Good size, materials, transparency. Handles are short; can't carry it in one hand"
'B07JJCJG5W','N/A','N/A','I bought a couple of these to store seasonal clothing (heavy sweaters, bathing suits, etc.) and they work really well to keep "in-season" products in them in the closet, and "out-of-season" items in them under the bed. Then I will swap them season-to-season. They hold quite a bit of stuff!'
'B07JJCJG5W','N/A','N/A','I was disappointed in the quality of the bag plus very, very small and shaky. I bought two many, many years ago, they were strong and still in use. Sorry I did not purchased more. Now the item is not the same useless. Go back to the original making of the Canvas bag. Thanks. Give customers their money worth.'
'B07JJCJG5W','N/A','N/A','Purchased so I can tidy up my closet and store my sheets and duvets. Due to its expandable design it will allow you to store multiple duvet sheets and sheet sets very easily and handy. I also like the fact that it has some transparency so you can actually see what is in the cubes as opposed to being opaque and digging through. Handles on the side make for storing up and away easy without any issues.'
'B07JJCJG5W','N/A','N/A','Nice quality but just not big enough for my needs'
'B07JJCJG5W','N/A','N/A','I‚Äôm thrilled with this purchase I plan to reorder. The material is strong I feel better about storing off season towels, sheets and blankets.'
'B07JJCJG5W','N/A','N/A','I wanted a cheap thing to ship a comforter in, that I had sold on Poshmark. I loaded it in, zipped it, slipped in the label, and shipped like that! Worked out well, without paying much extra for getting it shipped out'
'B07JJCJG5W','N/A','N/A','I love this comforter case fits perfect'
'B07JJCJG5W','N/A','N/A','The canvas is thin, yet very durable. Zippers work well, and don‚Äôt get stuck or ‚Äùjump off track.‚Äù The two canvas handles on the side are sturdy and functional. I‚Äôm using the bags to store seasonal blankets, so I ordered the closet-sized type, and not the under-the-bed type. There are clear plastic panels on the front of the bag, and on the sides. I would prefer no plastic panels, but I know some people prefer to see what‚Äôs being stored inside. Lastly, I love the gray slate color. Beautiful.'
'B07JJCJG5W','N/A','N/A','Zippers were broken on two of the items upon receipt.'
'B07JJCJG5W','N/A','N/A',"Whether you use vacuum storage bags with these for more room or not, these hold quite a lot! I currently use mine with vacuum storage bags for throw blankets so they're out of the way and you have more space. Definitely need to order more for like winter jackets etc."
'B07JJCJG5W','N/A','N/A','Facilissimo da posizionare, pu√≤ essere messo ovunque ed √® davvero capiente.'

'B07JJCJG5W','N/A','N/A',"Vraiment pas solide 1 √®re utilisation c'est d√©chir√© en portant en conclusion c'est une perte d'argent"
'B07JJCJG5W','N/A','N/A','Canvas type fabricEasy to set up, stores more than I thought, window is great to identify contents. Handle.'
'B07JJCJG5W','N/A','N/A',"I'm glad I tried this"
'B07JJCJG5W','N/A','N/A','Much bigger than I thought! Easy zip open. Very useful.'
'B07JJCJG5W','N/A','N/A','zipper is very cheaply made'
'B07JJCJG5W','N/A','N/A','Tolles Produkt'
'B07JJCJG5W','N/A','N/A','They serve a good purpose for storing our extra blankets and sheets. Zippers cheaply made but they‚Äôre fine.'
'B07JJCJG5W','N/A','N/A','tare right under the zipper, not worth returning'
'B07JJCJG5W','N/A','N/A','We have an old Aerobed that we use when we have lots of sleep-over guests. The original bag developed some holes and tears. We wanted something in which to store the Aeorobed. This is a Queen Size Aerobed and it fits great.'
'B07JJCJG5W','N/A','N/A','Just opened and set up and put in closet in less than 30 minutes. I will add a cardboard bottom after Thanksgiving when I use the contents.'
'B07JJCJG5W','N/A','N/A','This worked out well for me. It was just large enough so that I could store sheets and pillowcases. The one problem that is mentioned in many of the reviews is that when you pick it up it tends to sag. You would do well to put a firmer bottom on these containers.'
'B07JJCJG5W','N/A','N/A',"Using them for rotating summer and winter clothes in and out of storage. Dimensions appropriate for the purpose. Nice having the windows... so you can see what's in them. They seem just a little bit flimsy. I'll come back and re-rate them and will re-rate based on durability."

'B07JJCJG5W','N/A','N/A','Very happy with the quality of these storage bags.'
'B07JJCJG5W','N/A','N/A','Carini comodi ma delicati'
'B07JJCJG5W','N/A','N/A',"Des la 1√®re utilisation une d√©chirure est apparue au-dessus de la fermeture √©clair... Heureusement que cette housse ne sera pas stock√©e ds un endroit poussi√©reux ! Le seul point positif est que le volume qu'on peut y entrer est assez impressionnant. Je n'en recommanderai pas"
'B07JJCJG5W','N/A','N/A',"These bags are the best!!! I have been using them to store soft goods. Laundry, clothing, blankets, sheets! So much room in them! Very well made and the windows are great! I'm going back for more!"
'B07JJCJG5W','N/A','N/A','Not what I wanted'
'B07JJCJG5W','N/A','N/A','Great item. Exactly what I wanted to store my winter sweaters under my platform bed!!!! Windows all around. Handles on either end. Zipper works great (double pulls). Just filled it and slid it right under the bed. It was a snap!üòÅüëç'
'B07JJCJG5W','N/A','N/A','After ordering the hard plastic stacking storage containers I would never buy these again. Tear to easy!'

'B07JJCJG5W','N/A','N/A','Easy to use. Good for linen storage.'
'B07JJCJG5W','N/A','N/A','I bought 3 of these to store blankets in our utility room while protecting them from dust. The material feels sturdy, and the zippers appear good quality. The handles on each end make picking them up and putting them on a shelf easy. The price is decent also.'
