'B07Y9YB9L7','Harden has developed a Very Good Quality Product!','4.0 out of 5 stars','I purchased the largest in this series of the reinforced plastic toolbox. Good finish, sufficiently tough and spacious to hold your normal domestic tools like spanners, screwdrivers, slid wrenches, pliers, plus, wire crimper & cutter....., nut & bolts, faucets, ball valves, extension pies, SS wires....what not! Fitted with two secured clamps and one handle (for lifting), this sturdy box comes in handy & portable. On the top there are two transparent pockets to hold screws for your quick use.... .... Costly indeed! But it is worth buying, my wisdom suggests.......Thanks with regards.......Prof.....'
