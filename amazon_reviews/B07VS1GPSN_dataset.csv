'B07VS1GPSN','Title: Disappointing Quality and Temperature Maintenance','1.0 out of 5 stars',"Unfortunately, my experience with this product has been quite disappointing.  Within just one month of regular use, the original vacuum bottle I received developed temperature maintenance issues. The promise of keeping liquids hot or cold for an extended duration did not hold up, as I noticed a significant drop in temperature retention. This made my daily routine frustrating, as I rely on a reliable vacuum bottle to keep my drinks at the desired temperature throughout the day.  I contacted the company's customer service, and to their credit, they promptly sent me a replacement bottle. However, my optimism was short-lived. After a mere six months of use, the replacement bottle began to show the same problems as its predecessor.  The build quality of both bottles appears to be subpar, given the rapid deterioration in performance. It's disappointing to see a product that initially seemed promising turn out to be so unreliable. While I appreciate the company's effort in sending a replacement, the fact that the replacement bottle also suffered from similar issues raises concerns about the overall quality and durability of this product.  In conclusion, I cannot recommend this vacuum bottle based on my experiences. It falls short in terms of temperature maintenance and durability, making it a frustrating and unreliable choice for anyone seeking a dependable vessel for keeping beverages at the desired temperature."
'B07VS1GPSN','Perfect size','4.0 out of 5 stars',"I got the 900ml borosil vaccum flask for rs 900 which is almost similar to other well known brands. The additional sipper and The additional handle to carry the bottle are plus points And also we need to take 3.7 litres of water in a day so we don't have to calculate it we are drinking 4times the water in this bottle we are on it And the water is remaining hot/cold for 12 hours+!"

'B07VS1GPSN','Lid breaks easily within 1 month of use','2.0 out of 5 stars','The first time that we ordered the water bottle, the packaging was opened. We were able to exchange the bottle and get a new one. But after about 1 month of use, a sharp piece of plastic broke off from the cap and fell into the water. This is very dangerous as it may be accidentally swallowed. After the plastic piece fell off, the lid also began to crack. So, water also began leaking from the lid. By the time this happened, the return window closed, so we were unable to return the water bottle.'
