'B07T1LLL2X','The Best, Aesthetic and VALUE FOR MONEY','5.0 out of 5 stars',"I ordered them again for the sake of piling up more :) . I ordered a pack last time about an year ago. Honestly, it replaced all my pens and wooden pencils. The 1 mechanical pencil I used last year is still working without any damages. I still have 4 more from the last pack. Believe me, if you haven't bought one, u need to get it, it will save you a lot of money, and the handwriting with it is very beautiful + Aesthetics. One thing I would like to tell the seller is to send in boxed packages. Last time it was in a boxed package, this time it came in an opened plastic sheet, a bit dissapointing, the product could've gotten damaged in transit. But the product itself is Excellent. I hope more good japanese stationery are introduced to India, on Amazon."

'B07T1LLL2X','Bad design','1.0 out of 5 stars','Button is so uncomfortably placed. It nips into the fingers, should have been placed higher up. Overpriced, only because of bad design, otherwise a fantastic piece as mechanism seems way more durable than cello'

'B07T1LLL2X','Nice quality pencils.','5.0 out of 5 stars','My takes a lot of notes. It has been very useful to her. Since she is not able to put 2B and HB refills in different pencils, she can now take notes quite well. Unfortunately, the eraser that is part of the pencil is not of very good quality, she is using an external eraser. However, this is not a deal-breaker. Of course, it would have made her happier if the built-in eraser had been of good quality too.'
