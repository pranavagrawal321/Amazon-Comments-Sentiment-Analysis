'B0B4KD52ZC','A performance oriented easy to carry laptop- But definitely not for gaming','4.0 out of 5 stars',"What to say in a line? - A good one from lenovo but which can be improved...  Pros 1. A Slim laptop packed with requisite performance 2. An energy efficient CPU ( Damn sure for 15-20 W, the performance is really good) 3. Office 2021 included ( of course for the lifetime of the laptop) + Windows 11 ( Will take time for win 10 users to get adjusted to this environment) 4. Reasonably good battery ( for me, usual browsing about 10 tabs and 2 pdf+ 1 ppt about 5 hrs) 5. Just open the laptop and laptop will boot 6. The backlight is amazing 7. Has 8 gb ram that can be extended up to 40 GB ( Just add 32 Gb ram into another slot) 8. 1x Type C port ( Not tested for laptop charging) + 2 normal USB ports + 1 card reader port + 1 headphone jack port 9. You can upgrade the ram and get intel iris xe graphics ( you need dual channel for intel iris xe) 10. Reasonable webcam 11. 2 years warranty - But other brands only offer 1 year warranty bundled 12. The noise cancellation in audio is superb. The voice is super clear for me 13. PCIE SSD 512 GB Cons  1. VA panel ( HP offers IPS panel for just 3K more. Lenovo please note of it). This is the only thing which i hate. The colors are just same as a 35K laptop brought 5 years earlier. Only the bezels are thinner 2. The webcam can be 1080P 3. The fast charging when enabled, the laptop gets really hot 4. For non-lenovo users, the keyboard and trackpad will initially be an issue ( I was already a lenovo user so no much transition issues) 5. Definitely the speaker is not adequate enough if the fan is running. This speaker is even worse than the previous ideapad of mine. Even Dolby Audio's efforts are in vain.  The build quality -> I would say neutral. Not bad not great. But it would be quite enough. If build quality is a necessity, go for dell ( But get ready to spend about 65K for the same specs)  The Screen -> The HP 15s is better in terms of the screen  The battery > About 5-6 hours.  The fan noise-> There are three modes to select from. Even using the performance mode did not give much noise to me  Now coming to gaming... There are folks who want gaming in a integrated graphics. For those guys i would say, go for gaming laptop if you need FPS and quality. However very light gaming is possible here.  Playable games - Smooth ones with reasonable graphics 1. NFSMW12 2. Assassins creed Upto black flag 3. Up to COD MW 3 4. GTA V ( not tested personally but have heard about them)"

'B0B4KD52ZC','Would Never Recommend Lenovo even to my enemies','1.0 out of 5 stars',"Received a faulty system. When reached out to the manufacturer, they kept giving different reasons. From wrong purchase date to no technician available, they kept delaying the service. The local service center was equally bad. After 3 weeks of numerous mails and phone calls, Lenovo agreed to replace and asked me to approach Amazon and now I'm chasing both Amazon and Lenovo hoping to get my product replaced. DO NOT BUY LENOVO LAPTOPS"

'B0B4KD52ZC','Product not as described','3.0 out of 5 stars','Iris xe graphics are not there as mentioned'
'B0B4KD52ZC',"Don't purchase this product. Still if you want to, don't buy from Amazon",'1.0 out of 5 stars',"Don't buy any Lenovo product. My display is not working within 10 days of purchase. Trust me, there is no one out there to help you. I am going from here and there to get it replaced but they are only offering repair. So, you have to satisfy yourself with a repaired defective product instead of a new one. Still if you want to buy, don't go with Amazon..they offer less window for return and don't help you any further even if you are a loyal Prime member also. So, my experience is that stay away from Lenovo and Amazon. I will also give up my Prime membership next month."

'B0B4KD52ZC','NOT A RELIABLE/WITHSTANDING LAPTOP','1.0 out of 5 stars',"I bought this laptop just 2 years back and always have taken good care of it - and there have been NO accidental damages.  However, within the first few months its hinge came undone which cost me a large sum of money. The next few months the display caught an issue and I had to get the entire screen replaced which also COST ABOVE 10,000 RUPEES. Yet again, within the next few months the keyboard began malfunctioning - which I had to get replaced with the wrong model of keyboard that had no backlight transperancy BECAUSE APPARENTLY LENOVO DOES NOT HAVE SPARE KEYBOARDS WITH BACKLIT FEATURES.  I urge everyone to buy this laptop with caution or JUST DON'T BUY IT AT ALL if you would like to have a reliable laptop which does not demand incessant repairs (even with perfect upkeep)."
'B0B4KD52ZC','Good laptop!','5.0 out of 5 stars','I have been using his laptop for few weeks now. The display is good and has a premium build quality. The machine is fast and there is no lag. Battery life is on par. if you are looking for daily use other than gaming you can go for it!'
