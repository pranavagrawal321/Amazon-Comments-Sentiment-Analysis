'B07VX7PG1K','Cards are good initially but then with time,the print fades off','3.0 out of 5 stars',"The media could not be loaded. I did not purchased the deck for cardistry rather I loved premium decks so thought to give it a try. To my surprise, the first highlighting part was the print. It started to fade away from 3rd week of purchase. Deck feels smooth initially but then with usage, I don't kno why they feel sticky or prone to friction.  My suggestion,go for decks like bicycle or theiry 11 or Ellusionist and do not buy from here as they are too costly"
