'B09YCX5F52','Poor battery and small screen','1.0 out of 5 stars',"MSI brand value - seems good build quality though plastic body  Poor battery as new laptop show only 2 hr battery backup ( because of low battery spec)  Poor audio- speaker not up to mark - cannot be used for meeting or for watching movie or YouTube. One have to use external speaker or headphone  Screen size is very small- yes I agree it's 14 inch laptop buy very small screen as compared to other 14 inch laptop. My 14 inch Mac has much bigger screen then them. I guess when they say 14 inch then they donot mean actual screen size"
