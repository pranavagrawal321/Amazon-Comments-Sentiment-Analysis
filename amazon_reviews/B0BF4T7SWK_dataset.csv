'B0BF4T7SWK','Best product in this price range.','5.0 out of 5 stars','The table quality is excellent and sturdy. Installation was easy and there was support from the team as well. They call you and ask you if there is any problem for assembling which is a good initiative. The chair gets upto a good height. Sleek and rich look which enhancs your work space. Fair weight, we can dismantle and install it again within few minutes.  Overall a very good choice, recommend for people who do sit and stand work and need a sturdy and reliable option .'
'B0BF4T7SWK','Very Sturdy and Ergonomic','5.0 out of 5 stars','The table is overall worth the price, if you want to invest in your health. Over all the look and finish is really premium. Wobbles a bit on standing positions. You get what you paid for ... Pros: 1. The installation is fairly simple , they provided all the tools. Self explanatory, will also arrange a virtual phone call demo as well. Few screws can be tightened by the tools no need for a carpenter. 2. The up/down motion works perfect. 3. Good looking ergonomic table.  Cons: 1. The installation guide could have been more elaborative. 2. The white table top is easily scratch able and can get stain easily, a slight hit with sharp object will leave its mark.  Overall a good investment if you are concerned about your back health.'

'B0BF4T7SWK',"Don't Buy: Poor quality with manufacturing defects and very bad customer support",'1.0 out of 5 stars','I am utterly disappointed with the "White Mulberry Motorized Height Adjustable Sit-Stand Desk" purchased from Amazon for a hefty price of 20K rupees. The product they dispatched was riddled with manufacturing defects, rendering it virtually unusable. My attempts to seek redress through customer support were an exercise in frustration. After numerous follow-up calls, I finally received a WhatsApp call from their so-called technical team. Their lack of expertise was glaring, and their sluggish response time further exacerbated my dissatisfaction. The prospect of waiting an additional 5 days for a replacement part is ludicrous, highlighting their lack of quality control. As a freelance web designer, their abysmal customer support and tardiness have cost me time and money, including an additional 748 rupees paid to a carpenter for a futile visit. This is unequivocally a subpar product that I vehemently advise against purchasing.'
'B0BF4T7SWK','Satisfactory budget range product','5.0 out of 5 stars','Researched well before buying this. Single motor desk range from 20K to 27K. Got this for 20K and the desk quality is as promised. Table stability is too good. Overall desk weighs around 30kg and can be easily installed with the available manual. Single motor is sufficient to serve the purpose. Product is worth recommending.'
'B0BF4T7SWK','Sturdy at economical price','5.0 out of 5 stars','Sturdy table. Tricky to complete installation. Good price.'
'B0BF4T7SWK','Perfect for WFH','5.0 out of 5 stars','I bought this table after going through lot of reviews and I am completely satisfied with it. Table is very sturdy. It has enough space after I put a 27 inch monitor and a laptop stand. Installation is also very simple.'
'B0BF4T7SWK','Pretty good','4.0 out of 5 stars',"The product is good. Dimension of the products are as mentioned Strong, sturdy and heavy Could've added slots for the manual lever too like how it was provided for the table legs..it would've been easier to assemble"
'B0BF4T7SWK','Great height adjustable table','5.0 out of 5 stars','Writing this review after two months of usage: Product was delivered on time, great packing and contains clear instructions to assemble the product effortlessly. Support team followed up to provide the video demonstration to complete the installation. Excellent customer care support for mulberry to help us in setting things up in no time. Countertop is spacious will hold necessary office items like laptop, external monitor& keyboard, and mouse etc. Finishing was smooth, and height adjustment is simplified here by just rotating the adjustable jack. I have hesitated a bit when it comes cost but worth spending, one time investment and ages with you. Highly recommended product to buy if you are looking for an affordable ergonomic sit-stand desk.'
'B0BF4T7SWK','Go for it without a thought!!','5.0 out of 5 stars','Absolutely amazing table with excellent build quality. Size is just right for single person use. Packing and instructions were great. An extra was provided for each type of screw. Anybody who has handled basic tools can assemble it on their own. Movement is smooth and it’s great value for money since I don’t adjust the height too often and electric tables cost twice as much!! Very happy with the purchase!!'
'B0BF4T7SWK','Defective product received','1.0 out of 5 stars','The product which was shipped had a broken handle inside the box. The return pickup was initiated but nobody came to pickup the product. They are marking as pickup failed everyday and making us wait with the defective product.'
'B0BF4T7SWK','Insist on a installation manual as the installation video is inadequate','4.0 out of 5 stars',"All's well that ends well. Today we could finally set up the table after around three weeks of ordering it( inspite of being an Amazon Prime member )and very happy with the result. The table is sturdy and the height-adjustment feature is indeed its Unique Selling Proposition . Two major tips. Don't try to assemble without an installation manual ( they don't provide one with the product and you have to ask for it). Second , keep a normal screwdriver handy as you will need it to make holes for fixing the height adjustment lever( they provide an alignment key but that is inadequate for this purpose).The package has a number of labeled plastic pouches with different screws . The installation video has no reference to these pouches marked A,B, etc. Like us if you try to use the screws without having access to the installation manual there is a fat chance that you will damage the table top or damage the holes for screws already provided on the table. Worse, in our case the height-adjustable lever was defective as it wouldn't go in to the groove. Although Amazon refused to replace the defective product the manufacturer agreed to do so . The company people are however very nice and helpful. In the unlikely situation that your table needs to be replaced, insist on the company not to send the replacement table by Bluedart( as in our case it took almost a week from Mumbai to Kolkata although the defective table was collected and delivered to the manufacturer in 3-4 days time). Coming back to be table it looks classy with its black colour( although it is called White Mulberry!) And I would recommend it as long as you take the precautions given above. You will need about 30 minutes to assemble it."
