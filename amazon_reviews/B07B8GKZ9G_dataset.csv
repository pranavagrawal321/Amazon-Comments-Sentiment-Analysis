'B07B8GKZ9G','Best at this price','5.0 out of 5 stars',"I am writing this review after using this speaker for more than 1 year. It's sound quality is crystal clear. Build quality is awesome. It is giving battery backup of 12-15 hours if played at normal volume. If played at high then also it's continuous for 5-6 hours. Buttons are also easy to use. One extra feature Iike about it is that it has extra post for cable, which means we can use it after its battery discharge also while connecting the usb wire through phone or tab. It is waterproof also. So longer, I have faced absolutely no problem. Even my father liked the speaker. You should go for it. I got it for 1800 during sale. Best wishes ‚ú®"

'B07B8GKZ9G','Excellent Product ! Trust me I am a user for 7 years.','5.0 out of 5 stars','Before this, I bought JBL Go same model in 2017. It worked like anything for 7 years. I have travelled a lot. Even the outer layer started falling down. But the audio quality was good. I ordered the new version of last week. It saved my trust again. The same model with improved sound quality, design.  Cons: Only one caveat. Nowadays, C-pin charger is common. But they have given B-pin. Otherwise, I am fully satisified.'

'B07B8GKZ9G',"Don't loose your money in the name of JBL for this small speaker",'1.0 out of 5 stars',"Please loose your money by buying this JBL product ,the main reason behind this is battery life - tooo short . I had been using another speaker of JBL with less price range which was fantastic in term of battery and sound . This product is higher in price and battery life is too short and sound is also less . Major issue is battery in every other day it gets discharged by using only an hour or two. Even 1-1.2k rupee of speaker of Boat having higher battery life with better sound range .please don't please this otherwise you will regret like I am regreting . One more points, in my old JBL, if your battery get discharged you can put on charge and simultaneously play . But the new speaker if it get discharged ,you cannot play while charging at the beginning as battery doesn't have the much of power to play while charging at the beginning ."

'B07B8GKZ9G','‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING STOPPED WORKING after warranty period !','1.0 out of 5 stars',"The media could not be loaded. Suddenly white solid light appears, tried resetting with all combination of buttons but it doesn't go off. Now it went off but doesn't turn ON !! Tried connecting usb same problem. It must be motherboard issue.  Served me hardly for 2 years. Upon calling Harman JBL customer service, they offered a 10% coupon discount which DOESN'T WORK either !  This is a good product but don't expect it to last more than warranty period.  Very disappointed with such a big brand like JBL. Atleast extend warranty period or do a better job via service !!"

'B07B8GKZ9G','Please rethink your purchase decesion','1.0 out of 5 stars',"‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏èPathetic customer service.  What they showcase in ads what they sell is a whole different. Don't fell in the trap of believing their false advertising and reviews on website and online shopping platforms  What you have advertised about JBL charge 4 in the website is that (JBL BASS RADIATOR) dual passive radiators deliver powerful, ear catching JBL sound that resonates loud and clear  In reality:  .It sounds pathetic .no clarity .very high More than 3 volumes it sounds very bad. .no bass after volume 3  A 1300/- rs Boat speaker sounds better than this.  What kind of products are u trying to sell customers please explain?  If this is not false advertising please explain what is this?  JBL used to be my favourite speaker. After i bought JBL charge 4 my whole opinion about JBL and their customer service has changed because they have the worst customer service ever. Whatever you may say what they reply is that it's there on their policy page. I know that it's there in the policy page what I as a customer expect is to understand my problem from my point of view. I haven't got the reply that I was expecting.  RE: Harman International Case # 12966767: India CEO Escalation"
