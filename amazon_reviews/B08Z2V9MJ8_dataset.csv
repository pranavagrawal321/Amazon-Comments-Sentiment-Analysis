'B08Z2V9MJ8','Good but not durable for Athletes','3.0 out of 5 stars','I purchased it in October 2022, and in just 6 months of regular cycling, its back side was fully rubbed and became shiny. It is not durable, if it was durable, then it would have kept it non-shiny even after regular cycling sitting on saddle. Overall, in looks wise, it looks good, fits well, but ankle elastics are not as tight as expected which results in some cold air to come in while cycling in winters. Overall its a value for money product if not used by athletes for actual training.'
