'B0B2X1RR9Y','Pretty good and decent product','5.0 out of 5 stars',"The plastic used is of good quality. It's not unbreakable but still usable for the required purpose. It stores around 100gm of the spices in 1 section. There won't be any loss of smell due to the lid provided.  Happy with the purchase as it is worth."

'B0B2X1RR9Y','Very poor quality inside masala containers','1.0 out of 5 stars','The box itself is very small. The masala containers are of such poor quality that I threw them away and am using the outer box to keep medicines. Surprisingly it was Amazon‚Äôs choice. I think I would have picked up a better quantity product from the roadside hawker. The price was Rs. 170. Not worth even Rs. 100. Never going to buy any such products from Amazon in future. Didn‚Äôt want to waste time returning it. It‚Äôs not BPA free as mentioned in the product details.'
