'B08461VC1Z','"Stay Unique" - Premium finish, texture and class exuberance','5.0 out of 5 stars','Usually not the kinds of write a review. Having said so, Scarters pad deserves it. Upon unboxing, the moment you run your fingers through the texture you would know you paid for a premium product and you\'ve got your money\'s worth. The shade of navy blue and reversible yellow is classy, needless to mention functional too. The clip is bundled within the rolled deskspread and the engraving "Stay Unique", is a classy touch too. Well done Scarters! Nailed it!'

'B08461VC1Z','My first and Best desk pad','5.0 out of 5 stars','You can literally buy without second thought, quality more than expected'
'B08461VC1Z','Worst product','1.0 out of 5 stars','While it looks so elegant in pictures but in real life it is just average. Some artificial leather is used. As a mouse pad it is worst than a 200/- product. Very slippery and light weight. It always move the entire mat when you try to move the mouse quickly. My much cheaper Red Gear mouse pad is 10x better than this one. I wish I would have checked the return policy first; it is only returnable not refundable. Money wasted. Itâ€™s already day-3 of my usage and this thing has still not lost its corner fold which was caused since it was rolled tightly in the package carton. Pathetic. 0 star.'
