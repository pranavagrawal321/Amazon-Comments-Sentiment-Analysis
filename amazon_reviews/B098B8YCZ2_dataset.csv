'B098B8YCZ2','Nice pair of sneakers','5.0 out of 5 stars',"The pair is really nice. One of the best I can say in this price segment. I have tried Bata, other Sparx & even HRX sneakers but this became my final choice. The sole is cushiony & provide proper grip so that you won't slip. If you consider snug fitting then take one size smaller than your usual lace up shoes. Rest assured it won't feel you regretted."

'B098B8YCZ2','Comfortable','5.0 out of 5 stars','Rather than buying a low-quality Reebok or Adidas shoe for 2000, go for Sparx. You would get quality and durability as well. As for this particular shoe, it is quite comfortable. It does not have a shoe tongue but still has laces for tightening or loosening the fit.  It looks awesome too. I bought the black one and it looks good, especially with blue jeans.'
'B098B8YCZ2','Highly embarrassing','3.0 out of 5 stars',"Though it's comfortable from under the feet, the sides of the shoe cut like a knife does. I couldn't go for a walk for 2-3 days after first wearing. The sides should be round, not like the present one. Also it demands socks to be worn always. The embarrassing thing is that, the clear view is not seen in the ad pics. Also its full covering type, a lace privided is dummy. I don't give more than 50-55 marks out of 100."
