'B0BBQV5JWJ','Weird but...','2.0 out of 5 stars',"I'd say it's pretty ok for NORMAL USE and CASUAL GAMING but not for hardc gaming, this mouse give you the sweats especially if you playing a fast pace multiplayer fps games i won't recommend this mouse for those purposes. The clicks feel weird you have to give a bit extra pressure for the clicks to register properly hence not for fast pace fps gaming. The left and right click body feels wobbly too, it make me kinda angry how it wobbles.  And i can't seem to know or find out whether this mouse is made this way or i got a faulty product.  If you want this mouse for normal surfing then sure otherwise NO NO NO DONT BUY!!! ‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå"

'B0BBQV5JWJ','125hz polling rate','2.0 out of 5 stars',"It does not have 1000hz polling rate. I downloaded their utility software and I tried to find a way to make this mouse redeemable but there's just no way to increase its polling rate. It's your basic 125hz mouse which is falsely being advertised on antesports' website as something which supports 1000hz polling rate and that is not true. If you really want a mouse which has 125hz polling and some rgb then you can easily find such mice for almost half the price. Otherwise the build quality is decent and feels decent."
