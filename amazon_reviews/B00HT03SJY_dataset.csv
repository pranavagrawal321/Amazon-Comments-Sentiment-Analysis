'B00HT03SJY','"No burning sensation"-Fragrance is constant as the previous one','5.0 out of 5 stars',"I have been using fresh active for almost 2 years. 1. Fragrance is actually fresh. (Sweet kind of~ but not feminine) 2. Bottle print is new but Nivea have kept the fragrance as earlier version only(which is a good part) 3. & the biggest USP of Nivea's any deo is that (I have tried almost every budget deo in India), it doesn't give burning sensation after applying. Around ‚Çπ200, it is actually the best deo in the country. Kudos to nivea team."
