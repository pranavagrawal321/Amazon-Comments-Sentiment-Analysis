'B09BLXC85F','Very thin plastic','2.0 out of 5 stars',"The cards are too lean and i cannot get any grip to hold the card in place. It is so frustrating and you can't return it.

The one cons is the packaging is good and the box that contains the card is good but the card is definitely not good."

'B09BLXC85F','My best buy from Amazon so far','5.0 out of 5 stars','Review as goes;  Pros: Quality(9/10): 1. The cards are plastic, hence, they wont get wet or tear easily. 2. Comes in a sturdy box. 3. Value for money.  Cons: 1. As the cards are plastic they tend to slip often, though they have texture to help in grip.  Will I recommend, absolutely... Good for travelling due to its compact nature and sturdy build.'
