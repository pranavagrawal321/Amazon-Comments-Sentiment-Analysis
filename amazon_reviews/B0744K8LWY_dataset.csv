'B0744K8LWY','Soap formula different','4.0 out of 5 stars','Having used Pears soap in other countries, I can definitely say the Indian version is different in the sense of it causing slight stinging sensation in areas of the skin like the face.  So those with sensitive skin may want to test it out first.  Other. than that the product is a classic soap and reasonably priced.'
