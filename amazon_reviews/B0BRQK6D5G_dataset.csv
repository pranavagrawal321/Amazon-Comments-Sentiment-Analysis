'B0BRQK6D5G','Not Extension Board But Tension Board','1.0 out of 5 stars','What I disliked was the internal wiring of the Board. Only Red Color was used to wire / connect Phase, Neutral and Earth pins and points. No color code standards followed. I had to rewire from scratch. The critical part which I disliked was ‚ÄúNeutral‚Äù wires were connected to Right pin of the Socket (Front facing you) and ‚ÄúPhase‚Äù wires were connected to Left pin of the Socket (Front facing you). Scope for Electrical hazard.'
