'B0BCL7JTTY','Workmanship and Quality lacking','1.0 out of 5 stars','Stitching is bad. The side finish is zig zag and not in a straight line. Worst are the corners which hang like tails and workmanship is pathetic. Stitching quality is also poor and does not have uniform finish with the cloth showing up here and there. There are patches of threads coming off from the clothe. I am wondering if the clothe will last longer. Good design idea is wasted by the bad quality product.'
