'B0BF4VH2W1','Feels like poor quality wool.','1.0 out of 5 stars',"This is a woolen sweater, which does not look great like how it looks in the pictures. And it's also very uncomfortable on the skin. Returned this product immediately. With symbol branded products, always buy 1 size larger. Buy the cotton full sleeve t shirts instead"
