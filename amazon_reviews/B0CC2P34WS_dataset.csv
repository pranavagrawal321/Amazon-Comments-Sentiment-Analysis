'B0CC2P34WS','Defective product','1.0 out of 5 stars','The mouse is defective and is not being collected back by the seller despite of more than 8 days passed after reporting. Amazon please look into the matter and refund the amount'
'B0CC2P34WS','Fully customisable gaming mouse.','4.0 out of 5 stars',"Good product but bit heavier compared to my old Logitech g102 mouse, and user must have big hand‚úäüèªüí¶üòÇ in order to experience full given keys in the mouse , these two r the cons of this mouse. Over all it is the best mouse under 1200rs because when I say the bill the tax was 200 rsüòÇ mouse was only 1000rs cuz it's china product."
'B0CC2P34WS','Loved it','5.0 out of 5 stars','Overall experience us superb. Instant switch between devices. FYI: Bluetooth pairing mode is pressing left click right snd scrolling click at a time for 3-4 seconds (not given in instruction manual). Vefy comfortable while using as well (nice grop). Go for it. Currently testing the battery life ( 100 to 70% in 3 days of use).'

'B0CC2P34WS','Very unique features','5.0 out of 5 stars',"You might think the DPI is low but honestly there is no need for anything beyond 2k DPI setting EVER, hence I don't feel compelled to get anything higher than even 5K (which I feel is not required for anyone IMO). Apart from this, I feel this mouse truly glides and feels very very premium, that's what sets it apart from all the other brands. Especially their clickiness!  I really enjoy changing the switches and the shells, it is something which is very new to the market. I have not seen any other mice giving so many features and with such a premium built quality. Love the programmable buttons and the software that comes with it."
'B0CC2P34WS','Great value for money product','5.0 out of 5 stars','Great product.  The programmable buttons on the Chimera Gaming Mouse are incredibly useful. It provides a comfortable grip for long hours of usage. I am also using their keyboard, which also works really nicely. Really liking the brand overall!'
'B0CC2P34WS','Proper DIY mouse, can change everything here! Insane value for money!','5.0 out of 5 stars',"The media could not be loaded. Got my hands on this beauty and I can say it was absolutely worth it! It had so many things going right for me  Firstly, this came in such a classy packaging - i couldnt believe this is an Indian brand  Second, the whole product experience is top notch, from the multiple cases, to the switches - it is quite insane!  Third, performance wise this is as much as the top Razer and Logitech mice I've used according to me  The gamer in me loved the DIY feels, and it was absolutely divine putting this together for myself.  Definitely a buy at this price!"
'B0CC2P34WS','Great Product','5.0 out of 5 stars','Great product. Tried it and found it to be super comfortable and easy to work. I would really recommend it to others as it can be a game changer.'
'B0CC2P34WS','Worth it','5.0 out of 5 stars',"Go for it you won't regret purchasing it worth the price."
'B0CC2P34WS','Honest review','5.0 out of 5 stars',"I was afraid if the product was sold by a retailer or not, but when i got the product it was in a new packaging and the product was 'safe and sound'. And after i received i played AAA rated games with dpi which i preferred and it was so smooth and easy to use. Maybe you will find a awkwardness in your hand if you have used another mouse before this for long time, but if you use this for a while you will feel like its the best mouse in this price category ( 0 - 6000‚Çπ )"

'B0CC2P34WS','Best product','5.0 out of 5 stars','The mouse is really good for its price and the software provided is well optimised. Very smooth to use.'
'B0CC2P34WS','Very good mouse for BR and PVP games!!!','4.0 out of 5 stars',"I have used many gaming mouse in 1.5k budget. The best I had is the redragon mouse. I will still consider the redragon mouse as best in terms of the softness in clicking any button. After 4 years of using my redragon mouse (still no issues) I feel to change my mouse to test the additional fire button that I dont have in my older mouse.  These are the pros I found after playing Apex for 3 hours. 1. All buttons are very clicky and you will feel good to press each button. Except the scroll button click which is a little hard to press comparing my redragon mouse. (A con) I got used to it now. 2. All the side buttons can be identifiable while touching them and you dont need to see those. A very good feature which is ignored by many Big brands. 3. All buttons are programmable using the software. In the box you will have a card specifying the url to download the kreo software. 4. I kept the fire button as default and believe me, pistols and all single fire weapons (like g7 scout) are fun to play. There is a bug I noticed. Using the software if you change the fire button and again set it, then there is a issue with rapid fire. Make sure you set the default settings for this and change other settings but not the repid fire one 5. Set any colour based on your setup. RGB looks awesome. Support many pre configured RGB thems like waves, breathing and many more along with single static color. And its true RGB. 6. This supports 1000 hz polling rate and I have tested using 3rd party software. 7. There are many other features on the software which I haven't tested. In one word you have full control on your mouse. 8. There is a small button at the base of this mouse and you can customize it too. I kept it to change the RGB. 9. Mouse texture feels very comfortable in hand. 10. Braided cable and very good quality. 11. Good gaming sensor(PMW 3327). I haven't feel any mouse movement glitches. It is not the best but great if you compare with a generic sensor. 12. Two kreo hawk stickers are provided on the box. 13. You can set dpi from 200 to 12000 range and unlike many brands you can set any value multiply by 100. Means you can set 200, 300, 400 and so on till 12000.  Now lets discuss the cons I have faced - 1. Scroll button is a little hard. I have replaced my first kreo hawk mouse as the first delivered mouse had a supsr hard scroll button. Replacement had a better scroll button click. But still harder than my redragon mouse. Make sure to test your mouse and replace if needed. 2. The ergonomics is good for bigger hands only. If you have small hand you may ignore this design. 3. Provided cable length is very short. If you have your system far away than its not a good option. My redragon mouse have very long usb cable. 4. In some static RGB colour you will feel gaps in light if you look closely. 5. Delivery time is more in Kolkata location. Its coming from Bangalore location. 6. Not sure of any after sales support. I have send them an email 2 weeks back and still no reply. So be careful.  My own final conclusion - I have purchased this for around 1140 and I had to replace the first mouse. Comparing the price it is definitely a very good option. I have to adjust myself with the scroll button click.  1 star less as it needs some improvements mentioned in the cons.  Thanks for reading!!!! Keep playing."
'B0CC2P34WS','Amazing mouse:)','5.0 out of 5 stars',"The mouse is really good for its price and the software provided is well optimised. The only problem I found was that the extra key in the mouse(The hunt key) doesn't configure in some games. Other than that would recommend buying."
'B0CC2P34WS','Good mouse.','4.0 out of 5 stars',"The media could not be loaded. Can't say the best mouse in this price range, but will serve your purpose. It is bit heavy and bulky, good for large handed guys. Has a good software which can adjust or change the DPI of the mouse. There are some glitches in the software, the light of the mouse can't be change from the software."
'B0CC2P34WS','Very Good Gaming Mouse ( Coming from a former Razer, Steel Series & Logitech User)','5.0 out of 5 stars','For the price this is the best mouse for gaming & casual use .  Top features :  - 8 programmable buttons is blessing , especially the fire button on the left it has changed my gaming experience  - The PMW3327 sensor is great & I have had an unfiltered tracking & a relatively comfortable max control speed  - Feel & grip fits perfectly on my hand & RGB lighting add a great look to it, you can even customize the lights  Having used other brands like Razer , Steel Series & Logitech this product by Kreo is a game changer.'
