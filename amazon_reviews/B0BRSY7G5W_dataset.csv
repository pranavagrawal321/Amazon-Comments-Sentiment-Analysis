'B0BRSY7G5W','Good pen but wrong refill','3.0 out of 5 stars','Pen is good and looks nice. Well built but again I purchased it thinking it has jotter refil but it is not jotter but a new kind of refil. There is no ad about the refil. The Refil is shown in the photo. The pen by itself is not important but the Refil is equally important. Sellers must understand this.'
'B0BRSY7G5W','A GREAT PEN AND A MUST BUY FOR ALL PEN LOVERS!!!','5.0 out of 5 stars','Placed an order for this pen on 27 Jan 2023 and received the same on 29 Jan 2023. An almost flawless pen both function wise and price wise. PROS: a. Quick delivery by Amazon. Great job guys!!!!! b. Sleek and stylish in design and appearance. c. Good Grip leading to a smooth writing experience. d. Economical on the pocket at INR 220. e. Makes for a good gift for all pen lovers...  CONS: very minor a. Writing is a little scratchy in the beginning, but it smoothes out later.  All in all, a 5/5 pen (very few pens have received this rating from me) and an absolute must have for students and professionals alike. Just go for it!!!!!'
