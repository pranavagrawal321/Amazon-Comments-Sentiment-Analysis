'B00ZTY8MRA','Triggers hair fall badly','2.0 out of 5 stars',"Using this shampoo triggers hair fall in clumps. I was shocked to see with increased usage of this. Don't buy a combo if you are unsure it will suit your scalp. I have tried reetha and shikakai shampoo. It was good. I tried this with the same hope and I was very disappointed. Even shampoos with bad chemicals didn't trigger so much hairball in me."

'B00ZTY8MRA','Use this Shampoo (Khadi Herbal Natural) if want Bald head','1.0 out of 5 stars',"This is my honest review written after three weeks of use (three times a week). Before using this shampoo I had no hair fall or damage ( I have pure virgin coconut oil). Once started to use this shampoo hair fall became very severe and day by day it increased (initially I thought using this for at least two months consistently will give a better result but it doesn't ). While hair washing this shampoo wipes the hair very highly. Even after being washed with water, hair can be removed with a towel ( Pathetic and such bad experience) Be careful with this product. I never recommend selling this kind of product on Amazon."
