'B0B1377YC3','Major Packaging issues','1.0 out of 5 stars',"Why o why??? Like everytime?? Why?? I‚Äôve ordered this same deck for the 3rd time and again for the third time I received a damaged deck!!! üòû it's such a beautiful deck but because of packaging issue I end up getting a damaged deck!!! At least use something to protect the delicate cards from the damage!!! Very sad!!!"
'B0B1377YC3','Beautiful, Vibrant Cards, loved it, Go For It','5.0 out of 5 stars',"The media could not be loaded. I have so many cards deck and two raider Waite card decks I'm using for last 3 years almost for the readings... This one is the most vibrant and beautiful. Good quality, beautiful colors a Lil different thn the others, good energy, semi glossy finish cards. Comes with an illustrated guidebook, is ok. Overall it's a good purchase, worth buying."
'B0B1377YC3','Spreads like butter','4.0 out of 5 stars',"If your traditional tarot deck is small, this is big the size of your palm and the cards don't stick to each other and spreads like a butter. The images are large and you can see the details on thr card clearly, you will appreciate the size, clarity and quality of the images more if you were glasses like me üòÄ. I gave only 4 stars because the guide book is tiny, it has only 2-3 line descriptions of each card meaning and there is no representation of the cards in reverse. This does not help a beginner, having said that I love this made in China deck, easy to shuffle"

'B0B1377YC3','The energy is clean','5.0 out of 5 stars','Did a few readings and seem to get clear answer right away! More than happy i bought these. Colourful, vibrant, thick paper. Best deck available!'
'B0B1377YC3','Excellent deck of cards. Fantastic quality!','5.0 out of 5 stars',"The media could not be loaded. The quality of the cards is fantastic. The card stock, color and print quality is excellent. The shuffling is good too. I got this deck for an amazing price of Rs 739. It is definitely worth the money and much better than all the other Rider Waite knock-off decks that are being sold on Amazon India which are of poor color and print quality. The delivery was fast and I received it on the same day as I ordered it. One scope of improvement I want to mention, which in my opinion is important: The colors in some of the cards (few only and not all) differs slightly from the original cards. Though the difference is not that significant, it does make a difference since colors and symbolism play a huge part in the Tarot. Another thing is that some of the cards which have yellow color in them are a little too bright. This is also not in all the cards, few only. All in all, an excellent purchase and I would highly recommend. The pictures represented in the product info is accurate and so are the pictures posted by other reviewers. To show it exactly as is, I've also made a video showcasing the deck and all the cards."
'B0B1377YC3','Beautiful and Color‚Äôs r totally justified','5.0 out of 5 stars','The Color‚Äôs are actuall same like US games ‚Ä¶ and affordable'
'B0B1377YC3','Amazing rider waite deck at a reasonable price! Go for it blindly!!','5.0 out of 5 stars','Absolutely gorgeous cards for just rs 739/-. i was surprised to see the good quality of the cards. The card stock is thick with good paper quality. Images are crisp and vibrant colors with original pamela coleman smith signature and font on the cards. I have put some fotos to compare these with another deck which has dull dark and shadowy images. Notice the difference. These cards are clean and colorful. What more do u want at such a cheap price??? This deck is a good deal for those looking for a rider waite deck at a low budget I got it delevered one day prior to the estimated delivery date from amazon. Well done amazon for providing this good quality rider waite deck at such a low price. Its very sad to see that this deck is unavailable here since sep 22. Amazon must make sure to provide such amazing product for others to benefit too.'
'B0B1377YC3','Would recommend','5.0 out of 5 stars','Beautiful deck and good printing.'
'B0B1377YC3','What else do you want','5.0 out of 5 stars','You can buy this This are sturdy, images crisp not as much as radiant but highly fair enough great for beginners and fresh'
