'B07VYZ6CWB','Thin material... Not recommended','5.0 out of 5 stars','Thin material, peep through'
'B07VYZ6CWB','Not free size, it is loose','2.0 out of 5 stars','TODAY 17th Dec, 2022, This is pure white, feel is good and comfortable, full length but synthetic. Cloth is thin transparent, Bigs CON is it is loose on waist, but as I wanted a pure white I kept it. I had also ordered amazon brand pair of white and red leggings, but that amazon white is not white and creamish, so think before buying if you are 30 and below waist, it will not fit you. OVERALL GOOD. Only after few washes can give proper details.'
