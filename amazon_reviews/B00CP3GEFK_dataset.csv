'B00CP3GEFK','Great eyeliner for the price','3.0 out of 5 stars',"Pros: - budget friendly - colorbar is a safe brand - easily available - felt tip - great for precise wings - definitely beginner friendly - semi-matte - lasts about 2-3 hours in matte finish, then turns kinda glossy  Cons: - lasts for not too long - is not smudge proof, resistant, sure - has fallout after 3 hours - felt tip sometimes is messed up in the bottle itself  I am on my second bottle so I recommend it however, I'd rather get a Sugar one or a gel kohl simply because they last longer and don't move around as much as this does."

'B00CP3GEFK','Awesome','5.0 out of 5 stars','The texture of the product is awesome. It has a rich black color and nice pigmentation. A single stroke is enough and need not apply multiple times. It also comes off only with makeup remover or coconut oil. Do not wash just with soap as it will smudge and will be difficult to remove.'
