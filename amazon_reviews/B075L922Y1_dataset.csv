'B075L922Y1','Noisy one really','1.0 out of 5 stars','Voice of Radio is noisy. Difficult to listen any program. Difficult to access station . So main purpose of radio is not going to fulfill.'
'B075L922Y1','Working well since 2 years','5.0 out of 5 stars','Nice product with retro looks. Though the build quality could have been better, the product has been working well in our living room since 2 years. We regularly listen to radio fm on this. Playing the channels and changing them is easy. There are hardly any products for good quality radio to choose from and this one fits the bill. Go for it.'
'B075L922Y1','Retro but modern','5.0 out of 5 stars','The old-fashioned tuning dial and operating it to change the radio stations, the wooden-look design, the antenna, the adjustment of antenna (only at times) to get the perfect signal gives you the feel of a truly antique gadget.  On a lighter note, the reason I bought it is that it reminded me of almost a similar looking radio that my Nana ji (grandfather) had, maybe it was a little more lengthy and heavy.  So far no issues with it\'s features, built quality, and functional quality. Thus, I highly recommend a "buy" üëçüèæ if you are looking for a retro-styled radio with modern tech features like bluetooth.'

I'm writing this review after the usage of the Noizzy Box radio for 3+ years  Few weeks before unfortunately, the radio fell down and it was not working üò¢  Before that incident, it has been worked always as First day with clear n crystal sound  I called the Noizzy Box Customer care, they told me to courier the radio to their chennai office, I couriered it  After 2 days they called me and said that there is an issue in the board and it should be replaced and their price is very cheaper than my nearby electronic service centre  I paid the money and they serviced it and send back me to within 2 days  Now it's working perfectüëç  I hope it will work like this for the next 5 yearsü§û  I strongly recommend Noizzy Box radio to all of you  Product Quality - 10/10 Product Design - 10/10 Customer Service - 10/10 Moral Value - 10/10  I'm very happy to be a part of Noizzy Box familyüòäüòäüòä"

'B075L922Y1','Terrible radio','1.0 out of 5 stars','The same faulty radio was delivered to me twice and I missed the deadline to return it the second time. Most terrible experience with Amazon so far. Feel cheated by Amazon.'
'B075L922Y1','Looks and feels great','5.0 out of 5 stars',"First of all keep your expectations in check, this is strictly a radio with Bluetooth connectivity option. Now that we have set a baseline, its a good product for what it claims, it looks and feels like a vintage radio. Sound is decent and loud good for listening to AM,SW,FM you don't need it to have a booming bass with a passive radiator. On some levels its simple nature is kind of calming, people who grew up listening to radio will know what i am talking about.  No QC issues as of opening the box and using for 4 hours, i will edit the review if i see any issues down the line."
