'B0BN1ZG1QZ','Hangs, skips 50% call notifications, Lags in Always on display','1.0 out of 5 stars',"Review after using this watch for 2+ months.  The watch gets stuck at least once a day and have to restart it every time. The always on display has lags and doesn't display accurate time. Skips call notification 50% of the time. Works well after factory reset for 1-2 days and then start skipping calls. My view: Avoid"

'B0BN1ZG1QZ','Display','4.0 out of 5 stars','Display and build'
'B0BN1ZG1QZ','Lot of missing features for a 4999 worth Watch','3.0 out of 5 stars',"Pros - -Good build quality. - Awesome display with superior touch. -The chain adjustment tool. -Great battery backup (Lasted 7 days with Notifications ON, Incoming Call Alerts ON, Calling OFF, AOD OFF). -Almost accurate Heart beat and SpO2 readings. -Sleep monitoring feature. -Accurate step counting. -Workout detection. - Music can be controlled on the phone. -Water intake reminder.  Cons- - For a 5000 INR watch, you can upload only one watch face. The 3 default watchfaces look boring and cheap but can't be Uninstaller. - For a metal body and chain watch, there are no suitable analogue watch faces. I found only one suitable face which can be see in the pic. - Alarm on phone don't ring on watch despite of allowing notification. You have to set the Alarm on watch itself. - No Alarm sound, only vibration. - Doesn't ring on incoming calls, only vibrates. - The vibration is weak, you will barely notice. - No Warranty Registration confirmation received yet on the registered email. Registration starus can't be tracked.  In nutshell, the product lacks many features with it's competitor which is 500 rupees cheaper. I have 4 different Noise watches in my family and this is the costliest I bought. Can't say, it's Worth the Money. Can never compare with my Samsung Gear Frontier S3 (06 yrs old). But this one somewhat serves the purpose.  Thanks"

'B0BN1ZG1QZ',"It's an Hello to Other Swatches by Halo",'4.0 out of 5 stars',"Compared with Apple iwatches for health data accuracy it's always same and consistent. Call quality awesome and appeal wen u wear it makes ur day feel good. Go for metal case as black ones getting visible with white sweat/water stains at the strap pin points area and u have to clean it constantly. Other than that value for money and one among the best of best."

'B0BN1ZG1QZ','Terrible hardware and -10 software','1.0 out of 5 stars','The worst "smart" watch you could buy. The body came apart within the first month of barely using. The software is glitchy and is as basic as a kids toy watch. Avoid the Noise brand at all costs, it\'s a joke'
