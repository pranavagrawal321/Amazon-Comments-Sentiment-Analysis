'B09XTKJ1Q8','Worth product for the investment','4.0 out of 5 stars',"I bought this product with doubt, but, it was working as per the specification.

'B09XTKJ1Q8','Great product!','4.0 out of 5 stars','CONS: Contrary to the pictures shown, the product DOES NOT have VIBOTON logo.  PROS: However, PERFORMANCE of the product is VERY SATISFYING and the LENGTH of the cable is as it claims, about 1.2 metres. Looks & feals STURDY, too.  SPEED: Tested with 1TB External HDD (Toshiba), using USB3.0 Port :- WRITE speed: directly from the USB3.0 port - 65-70 MB/SEC. Through this USB hub - 30-35 MB/Sec READ speed: Both without & with this hub - MORE THAN 1 GB/Sec EASILY.  VERDICT: RECOMMENDED!!'

This one works well with power adapter. Added advantage is you can buy simple 1A micro-USB mobile chargers for that purpose. Seems durable with a cool blue light on the top port. Longevity have to wait. Overall a good product."

'B09XTKJ1Q8','Item is with wrong and misleading specs. (Description updated by seller after this review)','2.0 out of 5 stars','Only 1 port (1st from the cable side is Usb 3.0. All other 6 ports are usb 2.0. From outside all ports look like USB 3.0 only. But when connected only 1 port was usb 3.0, others were usb 2.0. I opened to see whether the ports are genuine with 9 pins, I found only one port on pcb to be correct. Other 6 usb ports were having attached 4 pins only on the board. This product is way too costly for what it has to offer. Wrong description and misleading offer was a very bad experience.'
