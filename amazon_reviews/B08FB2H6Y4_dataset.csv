'B08FB2H6Y4','Best for the price','5.0 out of 5 stars','Very nice speaker , with wide sound and great clarity.'
'B08FB2H6Y4','Non repairable out of warrenty. Beware ‚ö†Ô∏è','2.0 out of 5 stars',"I bought this speakers in jul-21. Worked pretty well for 2.5 years. Now the battery has got issues and the JBL says it is a non-repairable item. We can give you 20% on next purchase. No use of paying premium over 50-60% on any boat or similar competitors. Better to buy a cheap device to not face the regrets I have to face. Can't even replace a battery. I was lucky it lasted 2+ years. If you're not than it can break on 1 day after 365 warrenty days and you need to throw it as well."

'B08FB2H6Y4','Great for its intended purpose','5.0 out of 5 stars',"A tad bass heavy but that could be lowered using your phone's equaliser settings. It is loud enough to fill a small room and great for my intended purpose. I needed a small, water-resistant speaker that I could hang up nearby to listen to music/ podcasts while showering."

'B08FB2H6Y4','Most amazing sound quality.','5.0 out of 5 stars','For the ones who are confused between JBL GO 2 and JBL GO 3. If you are okay with USB charging then you definitely go for Go 2 because it has nice sound quality too and it makes 1k difference. If you need a little high bass quality and USB TYPE C charging then GO 3 is the one. Otherwise both the speakers have great sound quality so decide according to your budget.'

'B08FB2H6Y4','Speaker means JbL','4.0 out of 5 stars',"The product is very nice . Bluetooth connectivity is very quick and strong. Performance is also decent.the sound is good. The volume is more than enough for a hall type room. Base is also pretty nice though it could be more improved. But it's not that the base is bad it does preety well in this price range.battery is also strong.gives atleast 8 to 10 hrs of non stop performace when fully charged.also it gets charged very easily and quick...like in about 30 to 45 min it will be full charged. About service I can't tell ...cause I have been using it since more than a year now and haven't faced any issues,so I needed no service.

'B08FB2H6Y4','Please rethink you purchase decision','1.0 out of 5 stars',"‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏èPathetic customer service.  What they showcase in ads what they sell is a whole different. Don't fell in the trap of believing their false advertising and reviews on website and online shopping platforms  What you have advertised about JBL charge 4 in the website is that (JBL BASS RADIATOR) dual passive radiators deliver powerful, ear catching JBL sound that resonates loud and clear  In reality:  .It sounds pathetic .no clarity .very high More than 3 volumes it sounds very bad. .no bass after volume 3  A 1300/- rs Boat speaker sounds better than this.  What kind of products are u trying to sell customers please explain?  If this is not false advertising please explain what is this?  JBL used to be my favourite speaker. After i bought JBL charge 4 my whole opinion about JBL and their customer service has changed because they have the worst customer service ever. Whatever you may say what they reply is that it's there on their policy page. I know that it's there in the policy page what I as a customer expect is to understand my problem from my point of view. I haven't got the reply that I was expecting.  RE: Harman International Case # 12966767: India CEO Escalation"
