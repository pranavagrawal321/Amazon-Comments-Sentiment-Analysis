'B00ZYLMQH0','Sleek and type friendly keyboard.','5.0 out of 5 stars','21-09-2023; Today i got new keyboard,which is a Dell chicklet keyboard model kb216. i am not putting any pictures, because there are lot of it. i had my eyes on this keyboard for a very long time. its the most running model keyboard from dell. i didnt buy it before because i already had TVS Mechanical keyboard and i dont know why it stopped working. I had a spare old chicklet keyboard which i was using till now. anyway i finally bought and it feels good. its good upgrade from previous chicklet keyboard. - keys are smooth and low profile and i dont have to deal with that key wobble. - connection is good. - i have a very laptop with windows 7. i am able to use the ruppee symbol. have to see some other ways to check the ruppee symbol. my initial experience is good. and i hope that it will get better with time. if you like my short review, do give a like.'
