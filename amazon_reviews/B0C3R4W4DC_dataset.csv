'B0C3R4W4DC','Excellent quality and clear fm','5.0 out of 5 stars','EASY TO USE.  SEEMS LIKE COULD BE DURABLE FOR YEARS. FM STEREO IS EXCELLENT .  BATTERY CAN EASY EASY REMOVE AND REPLACED WHEN REQUIRED UNLIKE OTHER PRODUCTS.  CONS MP3 CLEAR GOOD, BUT NOT HAVING OPTION TO FOLDER SELECTION, JUST RUN OR SELECT BY TYPE NUMBER. SW LW NOT RECEIVED SINGAL EVEN IN OPEN BALGONY.  OVERALL THE PRODUCT GOOD STANDARD. FEEL IT QUALITY.'
'B0C3R4W4DC','Not upto expectation.','2.0 out of 5 stars',"The radio has many option to operate. Design is also good. But the sound quality is not good. Volume is very low. Operating manual is not complete in all respect. Sound increased or decreased automatically. The price should be around 2'000/-. Spare battary should be given with the set."
'B0C3R4W4DC','Best radio!','4.0 out of 5 stars','Best radio with all good feature you can expect!'
'B0C3R4W4DC','Nice Product','4.0 out of 5 stars','It is worthwhile purchasing\xa0this item. Good reception, good sound quality, and Bluetooth/SD card compatibility. The sound is a little low; it could be a little better. I compared it to the Pagaria R917 and the XHDATA D-808. XHDATA D-109 was significantly better in SW/MW whereas XHDATA D-808 was only marginally superior in FM Band. Pagaria R917 had a respectable 80-20\xa0margin.'
'B0C3R4W4DC','Very compact','4.0 out of 5 stars',"Remember the sound output is just enough. Not for old people with hearing problem as for me it's fine"
'B0C3R4W4DC','Not good,','1.0 out of 5 stars','Not good, FM pickup not OK. SW and MW, too much noise.'

'B0C3R4W4DC','Killer Radio - Detailed review','5.0 out of 5 stars','This radio seems to have some usability improvements which xhdata learnt from the past radios. The Audio has vastly improved on the earphones, providing balanced sound, not bass or treble heavy. It has smooth analog volume control and no hissing. The built in speaker is slightly powerful and has a bit of bass making the sound warm for easy listening. FM sounds really nice.  Reception is very impressive. It is quite close to the D 808 but can also compete with the Tecsun 9700DX. MW and SW are excellent. In FM sometimes there is overload with external antenna for some channels - here the D 808 handles better and the Tecsun 9700DX has DX/local switch and handles reception slightly better. FM is stereo with possibility to force to mono. Overall D 109 is quite good in FM and differences are subtle. I use external telescopic antenna for FM and SW as my apartment has concrete walls and the whip antenna only works near the window for SW. This happens for all radios at my place.  Full SW coverage from 1711 to 29999 KHz. This is the cheapest radio that has full SW coverage I think.  Firmware: This has the VF/VM tuning, so we can scroll through memory presets easily. The D 808 memory system is a mess compared to this. Tecsun PL310et is the best in terms of memory, configurations and tuning (etm). Display shows the duration of charging once plugged in. Neat little feature and I know now exactly how long it will take to full charge. Signal strength is the default display in radio mode which is more appropriate than showing temp. Another improvement over D808. Tecsun is the best here - displays what the user chose last time. A small issue is that sleep button has been separated from power button. So sleep timer has to be set manually every time. Memory has 100 presets for each band but 300 for SW. Excellent. I get about 120 channels(some images of course ) in an evening scan, so this is useful.  The temperature displayed is grossly incorrect and I had replaced this radio once for this but second unit has same issue. So I decided to keep this second one.  Comes with standard rechargeable battery and lasts a long time on a charge. USB C.  LCD display is better than the D 808, blacks are darker. LCD of the Tecsun PL310ET is the best by far.  Overall a very satisfying experience with the radio at a low price point and I have nothing more to ask for, if xhdata fixes the temperature issue in upcoming versions of this radio that would be great.  For listening to broadcast bands this is the best radio in the market unless you need SSB and AIR band.'
'B0C3R4W4DC','A boon for radio lovers','5.0 out of 5 stars','A pocket size little radio, love at first sight, i am an old radio lover and it just a boon for me its 5 watt speaker sounds really good. FM reception is very good with an external antenna it catches 50 to 160 kms far stations.'
'B0C3R4W4DC','Very cheap and unreliable electronics product.','1.0 out of 5 stars','The first set received was defective as no sound produced. It was replaced and the next item was worse - I couldn‚Äôt switched it on. Found the product very cheap and unreliable.'

'B0C3R4W4DC','Great Radio.','4.0 out of 5 stars',"Thank you Amazon for bringing the world's best radio receivers for Indian radio fans and I would like to thank Xhdata for making classic radios for middle class radio fans I was longing for this radio which is in my budget for a long time it's great and all radio frequencies reception is very good I am very happy but I think my radio has a problem as it's heating during charging I am using a separate charger to charge the battery I would appreciate if the seller Xhdata will provide me with a solution. üôè"

'B0C3R4W4DC','Excellent Radio !!!!','5.0 out of 5 stars','This radio is truly amazing. I read about its features, including the Skylabs Si4734/35 fully integrated chipset, which provides excellent quality for all bands. It‚Äôs fully loaded with great features for radio lovers, including Bluetooth and Memory card support, making it even more versatile for future use.  The customer support is excellent, and the radio supports both digital and analog tuning, making it a beautiful device. The auto-scan and memory functions are impressive, and I haven‚Äôt found any other radio that beats this device.  Also it‚Äôs support FM stereo if you are connected with Headphone. I didn‚Äôt check if it supports RDS.  As for my service experience, I bought this radio and noticed a tightness on the tuning knob. When I reached out to customer service, they offered to exchange or refund the full price without any hassle. It‚Äôs truly an exceptional product.  Unfortunately, I had to return this one as I didn‚Äôt have the option to exchange it due to Amazon‚Äôs policy. But they are happy to return the product.  However, I‚Äôm planning to buy another one soon.'

'B0C3R4W4DC','Amazing radio','5.0 out of 5 stars',"This is my first serious radio so what I write might not be accurate. I got this radio for under 4k which is a steal. Other radios from Tecsun which doesn't support Bluetooth or MP3 still costs a lot more.  The sound is amazing( for a radio of this size). It has some Bass and treble and generally sounds pleasant. With Bluetooth function, you can effectively turn this to a Bluetooth speaker.  Charges a removable rechargeable battery with USB-C cable which is real nice as we don't have to replace or buy rechargeable batteries.  FM, SW, MW reception is good and I have no complaints, with a long wire antenna, the reception becomes even stronger for weaker stations.  Size is compact and have nice heft and it feels nice to look and hold.  I cannot think of any cons relating to its radio capabilities. But for Bluetooth, showing what's playing on the screen (track name) would've been nice. It's not possible because it's not a full featured LCD but like the ones that's found on kids watches and calculators.  For the price, under 4k when I bought it, this is an amazing buy."
'B0C3R4W4DC','Superb Value For Money','5.0 out of 5 stars',"I have used many FM Radios, But this Radio has an X Bass Tech, the in built speaker produce warm sound with decent bass. Good sound on Radio & Bluetooth mode. I have played some music files via SD card mode but there's some cracking sound on every music files i have played. SD Card option is useless for FLAC files. FM reception is strong Getting every stations Inside my home. I need to check extra accessory antenna for FM stereo in my room, after it's delivered. I have ordered an SW/FM antenna from the same seller, I think it'll work for FM stereo.  Edit- Got the external Antenna & it works 100%. Getting every FM stations in stereo in crystal clear through headphone out. I'm giving 5 stars as this Radio Fullfilled my all Needs.Thanks Radiwow & Amazon for the product availabllity on Amazon at this price. I recommend this Radio for everyone, who's looking for a best Budget Portable Radio."
