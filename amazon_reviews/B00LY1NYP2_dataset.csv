'B00LY1NYP2','Best for kitchen','5.0 out of 5 stars','I needed a stainless steel scissor in about 7‚Äù/17cm for cutting milk pouches in morning.To my horror,majority of scissors I viewed on amazon had bad reviews,from breakage to rusting to bad edges. Had to even return an expensive ‚Äòkitchen scissors‚Äô. Finally I settled on this one with crossed fingers,thinking atleast Japan cant go wrong.Till now im quite happy,as I wash the blades with water each morning.But now I take extra care to wipe them after, as mentioned on the packing.'

'B00LY1NYP2','One of best Scissors','5.0 out of 5 stars',"I like: (1) it's design and easy grip - can be used with lefty & right both way. (2) joint of two parts are done with screw instead of robot so can be adjusted loose or tight accordingly as per how user want."
'B00LY1NYP2','Most ergonomic scissor I‚Äôve used','5.0 out of 5 stars','Pros 1. Great ergonomics for both left and right handed people 2. Perfect size for multi use pair of scissors (8.5 cm blade) 3. Decent build and sharpness for the price 4. Has a screw to tighten the blades if they get too loose 5. Nice branding on the blade. 6. Good price MRP100 but got it for 65 with free delivery Cons 1. Limited colors (blue and pink only) 2. Not the sharpest scissors you can buy with a somewhat flat tip and weird wide flat blade design 3. Long term durability is untested 4. Made in China'
