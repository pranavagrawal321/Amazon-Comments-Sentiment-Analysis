'B07KXS4CQK','Good bonding strength','4.0 out of 5 stars',"As someone who frequently works with paper, cardboard, and other materials that require a strong adhesive, I can confidently say that this tape is one of the best I have used.  One of the things I appreciate about this tape is that it is clear, which makes it great for projects where appearance is important. It adheres quickly and securely, and I have not had any issues with it peeling or coming loose over time. The 50m roll is also a generous size, and I haven't had to replace it as frequently as I have with other tapes.  Another thing I like about this tape is that it is easy to tear by hand, which makes it convenient to use in a variety of situations. It is also strong enough to hold heavier items, such as cardboard boxes, without tearing or losing its adhesive properties.  Overall, I would highly recommend the THEMISTO G TAOE121 High Strength Double Side Tissue Tape to anyone who needs a reliable and versatile adhesive. It has exceeded my expectations in terms of strength and durability, and I will definitely be purchasing it again in the future."
