'B07XYQJP5X','Worst quality product. Within fews cork was damaged','1.0 out of 5 stars','This product is not recommended. Because to the alochol level in wine, the stopper was ruined after only a few weeks of use. The stainless steel quality is unsuitable which ruined the expensive foreign wine.'

'B07XYQJP5X',"It's so easy to use.",'5.0 out of 5 stars',"I can't believe it's so easy to use this tool to remove the cork from wine bottle without any hassle. Glad I bought this product"
'B07XYQJP5X','Not sturdy','1.0 out of 5 stars','Not at all sturdy, the handles broke in first attempt. Had to throw it away. Looking for another one now.'
'B07XYQJP5X','Works perfectly!','5.0 out of 5 stars','Package contained the trimmer and the corking device. Both work perfectly. Trimmer is great for neatly getting the foil off the wine bottle.  The long needle goes easily into the cork, the pump requires some force, but it‚Äôs a lot easier than the corkscrew and the cork comes out in a smooth motion without any pieces or cracks.  It‚Äôs quite safe - the needle can‚Äôt be reached without pushing it over a bottle, so no need to worry on accidental use by kids.'

'B07XYQJP5X','Overpriced considering build quality and sturdiness','2.0 out of 5 stars','It came in a normal unbranded, nameless box. No company name, no details, nothing. Definitely low quality Chinese kind of product. Considering the debatable build quality and light weight, it is highly overpriced. In my opinion this should not cost more than Rs. 250.'

'B07XYQJP5X','A bit more needed.','4.0 out of 5 stars','A good quality product which would have been perfect if the cork screw would have been 6-7 mm longer. Then the full cork would be extracted easily. But other openers too suffer from the same shortcoming.'
