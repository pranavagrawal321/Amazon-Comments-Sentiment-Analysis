'B0BM9YMDNW','The texture is uncomfortable - not for people who like Soft Cotton covers','2.0 out of 5 stars','I disliked the texture- the dry weave cover is not only sweaty but for some reason the holes on the cover are not absorption friendly. Let me explain this-  At night when you‚Äôre lying on your back, any sort of discharge flows backwards towards the bu** is not absorbed but it further slides off the pad and wets the underwear. I hate it ! My daughter hated it too. It annoys the skin too. Hence have to change to a different brand every other day. Can‚Äôt wait for this pack to get over!'
