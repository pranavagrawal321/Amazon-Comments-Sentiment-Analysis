'B09BLX7P2F','Best cards you can get at this price!','5.0 out of 5 stars','These are paper cards with a plastic finish. They are very slippery out of the box and I had to break in the deck just like any other new deck. They are very easy to use and the quality is also very good! I use them for cardistry and I can tell you that they are excellent for it! Also the price is very affordable. If youâ€™re new to cardistry then I would highly recommend these as they are cheap and very easy to handle with great quality.'
