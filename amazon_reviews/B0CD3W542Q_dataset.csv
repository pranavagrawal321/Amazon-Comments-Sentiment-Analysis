'B0CD3W542Q','Good product','3.0 out of 5 stars','I liked the product, but was delivered with wrong size. Booked for size 30, but 25 was delivered'
'B0CD3W542Q','Okay product','3.0 out of 5 stars',"I will give a detailed review. Firstly it has only 2 pockets. You don't get pockets in the front neither at the back , only at your knees. I am tall girls and it fits me pretty well, though it's still shorter than my usual high waisted jean The material is okay okay. Soft on the skin but I feel like it's slightly thin compared to other cargos. And the elastic can make u uncomfortable. And I don't really think it's worth 700 rupees . And the stichting was also not clean. There were threads hanging around.  I am returning it."
