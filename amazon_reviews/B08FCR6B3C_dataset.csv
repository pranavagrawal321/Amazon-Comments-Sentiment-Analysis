'B08FCR6B3C','its ok.','3.0 out of 5 stars','The Genteel Battery Powered Wine Bottle Cork Copper Fairy String Lights are a great addition to any party or home decor. The pack comes with six string lights, each with 20 LED lights, and a total length of 6.5 ft. The lights are battery operated, making them convenient to use and move around. The cork shape of the lights allows for easy placement in wine bottles or any other narrow opening. The copper wire adds a rustic and elegant touch to any decor, and the warm white light creates a cozy atmosphere. These lights are perfect for indoor or outdoor use, and are durable and long-lasting. Overall, I highly recommend the Genteel Battery Powered Wine Bottle Cork Copper Fairy String Lights for anyone looking to add a touch of charm and warmth to their home or event.'
