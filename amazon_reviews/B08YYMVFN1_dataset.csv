'B08YYMVFN1','Quality and Size','3.0 out of 5 stars',"I would like to tell whoever is buying this,  1) you can get better quality aprons in market if you search more and buy from reputed scientific accessories selling shop.  2) size is very general, i mean you have to do alterations if you buy this, so be prepared because you have to definitely do alteration and then only it fits you perfectly.  3) DONT IGNORE THIS POINT!!!!- This is non-returnable and non-replacment product, In case of wrong product/size/defects only they offer replacement, if you think you can buy this and then later exchange for another size then you will lose your money.  4) If you want to buy then just see shoulder length and buy, rest you have to do alterations compulsory. 5) I think if you dont have a proper shop nearby that sells good aprons, then only you buy from here. If you have a local store and quality is really good there(like you can feel the cloth is thick, stitching is good,sturdy) then definitely buy there and not here. You will not regret buying fron shop as you'll get quality,size and at very low cost than here.  Please read carefully and think thrice before you make the decision to buy"
