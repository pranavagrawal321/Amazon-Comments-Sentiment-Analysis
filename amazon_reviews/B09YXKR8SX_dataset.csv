'B09YXKR8SX','Wrong info','2.0 out of 5 stars','Tip is not good enough to give precise shaping/lines. Also not an Indian product as mentioned on the product page. Plum is a Chinese brand not Indian. It is misleading. Country of origin is China.'
'B09YXKR8SX','Not smudge-proof!','1.0 out of 5 stars','Not smudge proof or water proof. Disappointed!'
'B09YXKR8SX','Worst eyeliner','1.0 out of 5 stars','This is the worst eyeliner I have used till now, the tip of the liner is always dry, it even removes the applied liner'

'B09YXKR8SX','DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY. GET SUGAR','2.0 out of 5 stars',"I've been using it since a month, and had to stop- not because it dried up but because the applicator is the worst. It removes the eyeliner more than it applies. The tip is always dry regardless of how much ink/colour is still left in the liner. You'll have to slant it and apply from the inner edges of the tip. It's a TASK! Just get the SUGAR eyeliner which comes around Rs.420ish rather. Sugar hasnt disappointed me yet."
'B09YXKR8SX','Best','4.0 out of 5 stars',"Slightly pricy other than that it's the best"
'B09YXKR8SX','Not great','1.0 out of 5 stars',"The quality should reflect in price. My frame of reference is Maybelline Tattoo liner, which is a great eyeliner. This is uncomfortable to use, doesn't stay on for long and God forbid if you sweat, the tip is not pigmented you have to swipe multiple times to get any colour. The tip is also very thick, making it impossible to do much besides a thick line. I wouldn't buy it again."
'B09YXKR8SX','Not meet my expectations','1.0 out of 5 stars',"It's like very thin line.... No liquid inside very dry form not much black color.. Don't buy for this price range it is utterly waste"
