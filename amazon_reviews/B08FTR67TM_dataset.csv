'B08FTR67TM','Not as good as shown and described','1.0 out of 5 stars','Very disappointed with the product. Would never purchase any solimo brand product. The metal to cover the storage falls down when the sofa is coverted to bed and when you put the mattress on the other half. the cover which is provided for the storage is smaller in size and would slip when you sit on the other half. Also the finishing of the product looks is not good.There are marks on the metal, looks old. Wanted to return the item, but there is no option to return after the installation has been done. Tried to reach the customer care, but always landed up on the same page which says that return cannot be placed.'

'B08FTR67TM','Defective piece of same item sent for the second time','1.0 out of 5 stars',"We ordered Solimo's sofa cum bed and received a defective piece where the storage hardboard was not of proper size hence we got it replaced. However, the second piece that came is also defective. The storage compartment has come without wheels on one side. Overall not a good product to purchase as I don't think the vendor is doing proper checks before sending it to the customer. I request Amazon to ensure that the vendor does a pre installation check before sending the item to the customer. This was also notified to the customer care executive, the first time I purchased this item."

'B08FTR67TM','Worst Product at an Expensive Price','1.0 out of 5 stars','The sofa-cum-bed is not worth the price. After using for few months the metal coating is peeling and falling down. Also, there is no support from Cloudtail neither Amazon raised my complaint on 5th Oct and today is 27th Oct still no update regarding the warranty or service. Very unhappy. I also have small baby at home and because of the metal powder and coating peeling it has made my baby sick.'
