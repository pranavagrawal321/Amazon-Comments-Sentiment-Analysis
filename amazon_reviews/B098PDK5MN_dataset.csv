'B098PDK5MN','Cheap Quality Alert: Amazon/Nike, Address This Shoe Disaster or Face Public Outcry','1.0 out of 5 stars','I strongly advise against wasting your hard-earned money on these shoes. I purchased the same white pair of shoes from Flipkart, and they\'re still in excellent shape after more than 2 years. Shockingly, I received the black version of the same shoe from Amazon, and the sole of both the left and right shoes completely tore apart within just 2 months, as evident in the attached photos. It\'s deeply disappointing and frustrating to see Amazon or Nike playing with our hard-earned money like it\'s a joke. I demand that Amazon or Nike take immediate action to rectify this situation. If my concerns are not addressed promptly, I won\'t hesitate to share my terrible experience on YouTube, exposing the lack of quality and customer care UPDATE AFTER 2 MONTHS:- There is NO HELP from Nike or Amazon I pwrsonally suggest nike revolution 6 is not good especially if you wanna wear in all seasons including mansoon I am using such nike from 2014 Amazon I very much disliked your service. An Executive named Afreen said me on call "if nike dosent helps you,then Amazon will give you all refund" But later on call they said you have exceeded your timing of 10 days you are not gonna get any help from us, I also have proofs. I WASTED MY TIME AND MONEY AS WELL'
