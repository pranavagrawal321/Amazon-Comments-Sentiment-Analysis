'B07N6LN57W','Good, but only at this price.','4.0 out of 5 stars',"I got this mouse for 250rs on Sale and the mouse is worthy for this price, software isn't great but can't complain when I got at this piece. 16.8 Million colors is a joke ü§£ and the mouse had got a basic sensor and the clicks are fine."

'B07N6LN57W','Awesome build quality','5.0 out of 5 stars','Nice hefty solid built mouse that I got for 250 in sale.'
'B07N6LN57W','Good product but 1 issue','5.0 out of 5 stars','The mouse feels good in the hand and sensor does not skip. Buttons are also configurable which adds cherry on top , but only 1 minor issue, the brightness of lights is different at places on the mouse.'
'B07N6LN57W','Really worthy Mouse for the price, but has a few downsides while considering its for "gaming"....','4.0 out of 5 stars',"First impressions: First of all, the mouse is awesome for the price 250 rupees. The mouse's quality was above my expectations. The packaging was done quite well.  Features: This mouse features 4 extra buttons (Two on the side and two behind the scroll wheel) other than the usual 3 buttons (Left, right and scroll click) The scroll wheel is pretty good too! There are 5 DPI modes. RGB Modes are customizable but there are some bugs in the software. The sensor on this mouse comes with a max poling rate of 125-130Hz which gets the job done in most games but for intense games it puts you in a disadvantage in the play. There are many other good mice, if you prefer higher poling rate like the Razer Deathadder Essential. This mouse comes with a normal USB-A pin and a braided cable.  Others: This mouse is best for palm grip users, but for finger and claw grip users this could be an option but, there are other good mice out there. This mouse is well suitable to medium size hands.  Few downsides that I found: I have medium sized hands. Due to the prensence of side buttons on the left side of the mouse, the area for the thumb decreases and sometimes results in misclicks during the usage. (While writing this review I reloaded the amazon page accidentally and all the progress was lost due to the side buttons) The poling rate is low, which is not suitable for everyone and every game. The mouse comes with a CD driver to install the mouse software. But, nowadays most laptops don't come with a CD slot. I had to visit their website for the drivers.  Pros for Minecraft players: This mouse is great for PVP and bridging too! First of all, this mouse can DOUBLE CLICK though it has optical switches! This mouse can drag click (about 16-20 cps easily), Jitter click (10-12 cps) and butterfly click (15-18 cps) comfortably!  Overall, I feel like this mouse is suitable for most games and work too. Hope this review helps, Cheers!"

'B07N6LN57W','Guys Stop here !','1.0 out of 5 stars',"In one line, if you want to use software of it than change your mind and another one like Redgear A-17  1. Build quality wise it's seems very durable, it has a premium finish also  2. All features works perfectly  But but There is a very big problem, it doesn't have a chip inside, it didn't remember any settings or preferences. Every time you plug out mouse or reboot your system it sets to default configurations of 600 dpi and other settings. It's very annoying to all time configure settings before use.  If you want to configure everytime you want to use, than go for it or Get better one , eg.- Redgear A-17"

'B07N6LN57W','Got A Perfect Mouse After Replacement','5.0 out of 5 stars',"This is the best mouse under 500. The 4800 DPI is more than enough for a casual gamer it's smoothness is like just butter smooth fly dpi and after using macros through software I got 20-25 CPS. I like it's click sounds.But one thing the product I recieved the first time was not having enough smoothness while scrolling and the buttons were hard to click. But after replacement all is perfect."
'B07N6LN57W','Best mouse under 1K','5.0 out of 5 stars',"Using it for (almost) an year the wire is breaded and is really good the buttons are ok-ish the performance is top notch my hand fits in perfectly but the only downside is the Wight but everything fine no issues.

'B07N6LN57W','Not bad for Minecraft','3.0 out of 5 stars',"This mouse can butterfly click 20 cps but it takes one month or more to actually the key to loose. So out of the box you can't butterfly click above 15 cps. Drag click max 21 cps out of the box 13-16 cps Short drag 16 cps max (really good for short drag) Can easily do moon walk and God bridge Not telly bridge Trash mouse for jitter clicker Alternative mouse corsair katar pro"
'B07N6LN57W','Heavy!','5.0 out of 5 stars','So before buying this mouse just wait and think! Do you want a high performance gaming experience or just a solid build? For games where speed is key, this is not worthy! But if you want to do casual gaming then this is fine.'
'B07N6LN57W','Value For the Buck','4.0 out of 5 stars',"Firstly I got this Mouse at 299 which is a steal deal. Secondly the mouse is good for the price i paid i think in 799 you can get better options as the Glide of the mouse on the mousepad has resistance.
