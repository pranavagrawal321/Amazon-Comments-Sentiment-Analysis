'B0BRMZP2CG','Not worth the money','1.0 out of 5 stars',"The product seems to be very very flimsy. It's nothing but a plastic box in aristocrat design. Very poor quality. It is said as offer amount of Rs.2100 with it's original price 7500. But the original cost itself is not worth 2100. I got cheated by this order. Don't want to return as I don't want to stress myself to get back my money or any product in exchange. Anyhow I am using it as a storage box in my wardrobe which is not the purpose of it's buying. I need to purchase a good quality one in person to a shop for my actual need to Travel."

'B0BRMZP2CG','Better than expected','5.0 out of 5 stars',"From a capacity to cost perspective, this is pretty much a bargain. Given that this is check-in baggage that is going to be thrown around by carefree airline staff, I think this is attractively priced for the quality. Other pricier check-in bags I've had usually had broken wheels after 2-3 years of use and replacing wheels at local shops is expensive. Might as well get this!  The plus side of having a not-really-hard-body case is that it's lightweight so you don't waste a lot of your allowable capacity on the weight of bag itself. I expect this to last 3 years or so."
