'B01LYLJ99X','its small but not fast','3.0 out of 5 stars',"I bought this for my i20 car just bcoz of its size and fits perfectly in the small storage tray without reducing the storage capacity. . issue of having normal pendrive would be of breaking as they are protruding from the connector . its steel and lasts long. my purpose of buying this is accomplished. if you are buying this for daily storage of your files or movies then, i really don't recommend it as it takes ages to copy & u'll be frustrated. overall i give 3-3.5 to this product."
