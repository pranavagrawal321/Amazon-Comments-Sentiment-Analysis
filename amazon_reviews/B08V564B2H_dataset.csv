'B08V564B2H',"Hand crafted 'Made in India'",'5.0 out of 5 stars',"What's not to like about an Indian made product especially one crafted so nicely. Surfaces of the cork are very nicely shaped and finished. The fit in a wine bottle is tight ensuring there is no leakage. I bought these to bottle my home made wines. Manufacturer takes great pride in their product and it shows. Don't choose another, go for this one when you need corks for wine bottle."

'B08V564B2H','An Excellent product to cover bottles','5.0 out of 5 stars','The media could not be loaded. I liked this product very much. Keeping dringking water in plastic bootels are not safe for health at Extreme clod conditions plastic reacts with water. Glass bottles are safe for helth. I store water, coocking oil in these bottels and cover with this cork caps. cork are a netural product.'
