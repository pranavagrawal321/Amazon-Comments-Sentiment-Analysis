'B07LDKFM2Y','Highly priced average quality product','2.0 out of 5 stars',"Since scotch Brite is a brand name, my expectations from the product was high. Unfortunately, the product is highly priced for the kind of quality and durability you get. The bucket is too small and flimsy, the mop is too soft and the rinse bucket is below average.  I am not sure why I would pay 1089‚Çπ for such a mediocre product. My suggestion would be to look somewhere else. I suppose there are similar or more affordable products but with better quality and durability and in some cases better features.  Highly disappointed with the item's quality and pricing."
