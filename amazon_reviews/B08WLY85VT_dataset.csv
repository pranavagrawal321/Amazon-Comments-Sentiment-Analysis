'B08WLY85VT','Good support; mouse pad size could be larger','4.0 out of 5 stars','I liked the overall firmness and height of the gel support area.

'B08WLY85VT','Very comfortable to use. 100% recommend!','5.0 out of 5 stars',"I was facing constant wrist pain because of using my mouse for long hours.
