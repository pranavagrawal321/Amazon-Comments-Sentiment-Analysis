'B01IEVIVAC','Best brand.','5.0 out of 5 stars',"I ordered this product at 10.30 pm and it was delivered the next day well before 7.00am.  We wanted to play in the morning and it arrived in time for the morning play. I had not expected that.  Good for beginners and intermediate players.  Lasts long. It will last for 3-5 games if kids/beginners are playing.  For better players it will last for 10+games.  It will only break if the racquet frame hits the 'feather' a couple of times."

'B01IEVIVAC','Poor quality','1.0 out of 5 stars',"I bought this badminton shuttlecock because it was the cheapest option available. However, I quickly realized that I got what I paid for. The plastic is very thin and flimsy, and the shuttlecock doesn't fly very well. It's also very easy to break, even with gentle use.  I would not recommend this shuttlecock to anyone who is serious about badminton. It's only suitable for very casual players who don't mind sacrificing quality for price.  Pros:  Inexpensive  Cons:  Poor quality plastic Doesn't fly well Easy to break  Overall:  I would not recommend this badminton shuttlecock. It's only suitable for very casual players who don't mind sacrificing quality for price."
