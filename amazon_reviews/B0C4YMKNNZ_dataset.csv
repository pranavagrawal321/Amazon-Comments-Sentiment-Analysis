'B0C4YMKNNZ','Display issue within one month.','2.0 out of 5 stars','I bought this product on 8th September and on 2nd October a line appered on the centre of the screen. Not even survived one month. Never expected this from a brand like Samsung.Really pathetic.'
'B0C4YMKNNZ','Stand is a concern','2.0 out of 5 stars','I purchased the the LS24C360EAWXXL variant of the product, everything is good but stand is a major concern, it is not movable which is causing problem for eyes, when i look at monitor its seems looking downside which is not a good thing. Stand should be adjustable. Samsung should mention this while selling. Adjustable stand is very common which comes with every monitor.  its not suiting my requirement.'

'B0C4YMKNNZ','After 3 weeks from purchase...OK!','3.0 out of 5 stars','We received this product but it was not sealed at all, seems to be open box and sold like that, one disadvantage is cannot scale up or down stand so only option is to use VESA stand. After using for 3 weeks,sounds fine and no issue observed...all is well, three-star for not sending in "sealed"...'

'B0C4YMKNNZ','Affordable Immersion: Great Monitor for Non-Gamers','4.0 out of 5 stars',"This monitor, while not ideal for gaming, pleasantly surprised me considering its price. The picture quality is excellent, with vibrant colors and sharp details. However, it's not designed for gaming enthusiasts. What sets this monitor apart is the curved screen, which creates an immersive experience for watching movies and series. If you're not a hardcore gamer and want an affordable monitor for everyday tasks and media consumption, this one is worth considering."

'B0C4YMKNNZ','NEVER BUY OUTDATED MONITORS','1.0 out of 5 stars','Never buy outdated Monitors. This is a garbage product. No sound support, no speakers, no Samsung support. Amazon will sell garbage too. We have to decide whether to buy from Amazon or any realistically support vendors. Hopeless experience with Amazon India and Amazon support. Samsung already badly well known about their after sales service. Approaching them is a nightmare. The Toll free number provided with the product is not the correct one - as expected. You cannot call Samsung you cannot approach them via website. Horrible experience indeed and Lessons learned.'
'B0C4YMKNNZ','Replacement processed for jog button','3.0 out of 5 stars','Everthing is fine, only jog button is not working flawlessly. Its impossible to perform up and right navigation. Replacement has been processed just after opening box after 10 minutes. Waiting for new product.. i dont know why samsung has this joh button instead of simple buttons. This button is not user friendly.'

'B0C4YMKNNZ','Basic Monitor for everyday usage','3.0 out of 5 stars',"Loved the curvy aspect at this price point. There is no color bleeding. It's extremely light weight to the extent where I can't even turn on my fan at top speed. The monitor comes with a manual, adapter, and a HDMI cable. Clarity of the letters and words are very average. Monitor is slightly tiltable but there is no height adjustment. Overall its decent for everyday usage but if you have to work long hours, not a good choice."
