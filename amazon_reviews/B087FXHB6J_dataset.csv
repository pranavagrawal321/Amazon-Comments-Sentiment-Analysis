'B087FXHB6J','Can give this a skip','2.0 out of 5 stars',"I've been using this for a few months now, this isn't my main keyboard and mouse, mostly used it for remote usage, when I wasn't at my desk and needed to use it from afar.  The keyboard quality is really cheap, most of the times the keys are hard to press. Typing isn't very easy as well, for the most parts you would need to type at lower speeds to avoid double clicking of keys.  The mouse also has clicking issues, where in it will either double click, or not register a click.  I would suggest instead spending a bit more and getting a Dell or Logitech keyboard and mouse."
