'B07Q7NSX3B','Price is on much higher side for the material','2.0 out of 5 stars','Too expensive for the material used, not more than 200 rupees worth.'
'B07Q7NSX3B','Fabric is great but the elastic rubber band is easily lost.','4.0 out of 5 stars','One of the best adjustable belt to use and the fabric material is good. Size is proper and looks great with both formals and casual wear. The small elastic rubber band to tuck the extra length is easily lost and not a good implementation. No extra available as well.'
'B07Q7NSX3B','Great fit, comfortable throughout the day','4.0 out of 5 stars',"This was my first time with a double D ring belt, and I was surprised with how good it was. I expected the belt to loosen over the day, but it didn't budge an inch. It's a bit of an effort to get it through all the hoops on the pants, but that's something to get used to. It comes with an elastic strap to tuck the ends of the belt and prevent it from flapping around. It's a good touch, but it makes it a bit more harder to get the belt through the hoops. The material seems durable, but it needs to be seen, how long it lasts with daily usage. Overall, I'd recommend this."

'B07Q7NSX3B','Price is more, Quality and price not matching.','2.0 out of 5 stars','The media could not be loaded. Belt is not at all looks like the way it described in product description, stritching quality is very poor. Belt is very thin, really doubt about durability. I am keeping it only because of the need, my advice is not to go with this product as the quality is not matching with price. It does not worth of RS. 550/-'
'B07Q7NSX3B','Inferior quality','1.0 out of 5 stars',"The cloth used to make the belt is light and the thickness is lot less than you'd expect. If the cloth used to make this belt isn't thick, you'd have it contort and make you feel uncomfortable"

'B07Q7NSX3B','Hard across the width and thin to feel','2.0 out of 5 stars','The strap used is hard across its width, does not feel nice to touch, coarse in texture. Also the strap is thin, though not likely to get tore apart over time. Functional as a belt, but nothing fashionable about it. Seems much overpriced compared to its quality and appearance.'

'B07Q7NSX3B','Face canvas belt','1.0 out of 5 stars','The belt has only upper layer of cotton which is stitched over some undurable stuff. Based on its price it should listed as 50/-'
'B07Q7NSX3B','Over-priced belt that is not likely to last for a long time','3.0 out of 5 stars',"At this price point (Rs. 599/-) the customer should not expect more than an 'average' belt that will not last for a long time, unless it is USED ONLY OCCASIONALLY as a fashion accessory. Although the D-Ring buckle is made of metal, the canvas webbing of the belt and the leather patch at the end of the belt (held in place with single stitching) does not feel durable enough to withstand the rigours of daily use."

'B07Q7NSX3B','Not worth the price','1.0 out of 5 stars','Bought a similar belt 4 years ago at 150 rupees at a local shop, it is still doing well just some worn out threads flying around. My old belt has more thickness than this product, the metal is also bigger and more sturdier. This one slips sometimes and making it loose once a while if you are physically active.
