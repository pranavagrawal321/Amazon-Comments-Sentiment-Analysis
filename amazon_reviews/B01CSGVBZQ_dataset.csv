'B01CSGVBZQ','So far so nice','5.0 out of 5 stars',"Good, better..  Travelled nice together since a week or two. Let's see how far do they come along keeping their 5 stars here.  Durability matters boss, if you will not accompany the durability, I will cut down your one star (there won't be any star-fall for that), & colour fades, one more star from the rating here would be shredded.  So, you scotch tape, remember this very well, you better do!"

'B01CSGVBZQ','DO READ BEFORE BUYING!!!','3.0 out of 5 stars',"So 3M is a very reputed brand and thinking the same thing I went for this product. The packaging was great and had 2 complete rolls.  The quality of the tape itself is awesome, the adhesive is great, the quality of the tape itself is good.  The only issue is, the tape seems to be precut, both the rolls. I mean you can see on the 3rd image that there is a line that goes till the center so you wont be able to control the length of the tape that you need if you purchase this. It wasn't an issue with me but might be for you so do remember that. The length of the tape that you can get on every pull is 20cm."
