'B095362K3K','Never recommend HP monitor (M24f)','2.0 out of 5 stars','I will never recommend HP monitor (M24f), especially for graphic and video editing work.  After using it for a year, a line suddenly appeared on my monitor. After complaining to HP call support, a total of 3 monitors were replaced, including one old and two new monitors.  Monitors that are replaced under warranty are supposed to be new, but HP first tried to repair the old monitor. After complaining again, two new monitors were provided, and both of them had screen bleed and excessive IPS glow issues.  It has been two months since the complaint for monitor replacement, but no concrete steps have been taken by HP. In fact, there has been no response from HP for almost a month.'
