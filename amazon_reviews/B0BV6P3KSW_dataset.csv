'B0BV6P3KSW','N/A','N/A','Cute but battery life is short. Only works well on fridge. Sounds tinny. Sounds great inside the fridge'
'B0BV6P3KSW','N/A','N/A','It’s little and mighty. I love the sound on my refrigerator.'
'B0BV6P3KSW','N/A','N/A','Small compact'
'B0BV6P3KSW','N/A','N/A','This is my 3rd Muzen products. That says it all! Excellent quality!'
'B0BV6P3KSW','N/A','N/A',"I love this magnet, even if the sound isn't the greatest. It doesn't get very loud and sounds a bit tinny, but it's a magnet. It syncs up with bluetooth very easily. It is fun to kind of freak people out when they go to open the refrigerator and I tap a song on my phone that starts up when they open it. That was worth it for me."
'B0BV6P3KSW','N/A','N/A',"When I got it, I was a little disappointed cause it was so small. I figured it wouldn't be that good. I was wrong, dead wrong. It kicks and is loud. I love the retro look, and the magnet to put on the fridge makes it ever better. You want a cute novelty speaker that works? This is it!"
'B0BV6P3KSW','N/A','N/A',"This is a neat little gadget. It seems a little fragile like if I accidentally drop it that it might break. It's pretty much made of all plastic with a small magnet on the back. The magnet is pretty strong. It hasn't fell off of my refrigerator even with how my kids like to always slam the door. It was very easy to pair up to my phone.  The battery life life is ok. The sound quality is ok for what it is. It doesn't have any bass. With that being said I wasn't really expecting it to a lot of bass anyway. I will say that it's great for listening to podcasts or audio books.  The main feature that I think is cool, is how when I stick it to my refrigerator it turns it into a Bluetooth speaker. My kids love it."
'B0BV6P3KSW','N/A','N/A','This Muzen speaker is fantastic. The speaker is little but powerful. I would purchase this speaker if your looking for good sounding little speaker'
'B0BV6P3KSW','N/A','N/A',"It's cute alright - too bad it won't work."
'B0BV6P3KSW','N/A','N/A','It looks awesome on my fridge. The volume is loud. This is the third product I got from Muzen! Does not disappoint as usual!!!'
'B0BV6P3KSW','N/A','N/A','Got a metal surface? A refrigerator? A dishwasher? A washing machine? A dryer? Yes? Then you need this item. Set it up like any wireless audio device, stick it on any metallic surface and enjoy hours of wireless music enjoyment without earbuds or headphones. The speaker itself is quite small, but the audio quality is surprisingly good for a speaker of this size. These small "stick anywhere" speakers are just the thing when travelling through the concrete jungle where metal surfaces abound. They are a very good deal at the current price range.'
'B0BV6P3KSW','N/A','N/A','This works really great surprisingly. I was shocked by how well it works'
'B0BV6P3KSW','N/A','N/A',"The Muzen OTR Sticker Bluetooth Speaker is a super cool magnetic bluetooth speaker that you can sync with your phone (or other devices) and use it as the speaker. I have mine on my fridge and turn it on and connect my phone to it when i'm in the kitchen. The volume is pretty powerful and the battery lasts a long time. Its super easy to charge and uses the same charger as my phone. You can stick it on any metal surface plus it looks so cool with the retro style and easy to take anywhere. I highly recommend this speaker."
'B0BV6P3KSW','N/A','N/A',"This little dude is so fun! I had low expectations for a speaker at this price, but I was a bit stunned how loud and clear it could project given the right environment. Without a backing to amplify, the speaker is somewhat weak and unimpressive, but when magnetized to something like a fridge, it becomes surprisingly robust. You'll have to experiment to find the ideal placement. It's probably smaller than you expect, about the size of a credit card. The on-off jingle is the historic telegraph SOS pattern (I think) which is cute. Super easy to connect and use. Worth your pocket money!"
'B0BV6P3KSW','N/A','N/A',"The media could not be loaded. This little speaker was the easiest thing I've ever hooked to my Bluetooth and it sounds great!"
'B0BV6P3KSW','N/A','N/A','I am so impressed with this speaker - it took me a little bit of time to set this up, but once I figured it out I was highly impressed by the clear sound. I also loved that it is magnetic - I stuck it to my fridge and it has been a perfect cooking companion. Even the retro design is a clever, engaging detail. I played it for three hours during a dinner party last weekend and had no complaints about the battery life. Bonus points for being rechargeable with the same cord I use for my kindle!'
'B0BV6P3KSW','N/A','N/A','I plugged this in straight out of the box to test it. I listened to about 10 songs before it died. When magnetized to my fridge, the sound output was loud enough to reach a few rooms in my house. Kitchen, dining room, and softly from the living room.  After charging it lasted about 2 hours before it died again but had it on the highest setting. I think this is a cute little speaker that is excellent value for the money spent.'
'B0BV6P3KSW','N/A','N/A',"I love this thing. Is it the best quality speaker you can have? No, it's simple compact and most of it's sound comes from reflecting off a hard surface, like a refrigerator door. But the battery life is great, you can take it anywhere, and throw it up for some easy impromptu Spotify listening. The design is also very fun and retro, it reminds me of old appliances in my grandmother's 70s decor home."
'B0BV6P3KSW','N/A','N/A','This little adorable red speaker fits perfectly on my fridge. Every morning before breakfast I just crank up the tunes straight from the “radio” for a retro vibe. I wished it worked as a standalone speaker but unfortunately it only plays sound when attached to a metal surface by magnet.'
'B0BV6P3KSW','N/A','N/A',"This magnetic speaker is the size of a refrigerator magnet, and it has a fun, retro look. The speaker is rechargeable and offers fairly loud, decent quality audio for such a tiny speaker. My family was impressed!  The speaker has two small non-functioning silver knobs on the bottom, a larger backlit control knob and four fake speaker grills. The speaker powers on by pressing down on the control knob. That will also turn on the backlighting behind the knob and the green status light will start blinking. Once the speaker is paired with your phone, the control knob also controls the volume. The knob can be turned past 360 degrees, which was a bit confusing at first.  Overall, this is a very unique and fun speaker that works well for its size. It's small magnetic size makes it easy to have in your kitchen or elsewhere without taking up a lot of space or losing it. Highly recommend!"
'B0BV6P3KSW','N/A','N/A','This review is for the MUZEN OTR Sticker Speaker (Color: Green). I received a free taxable sample of this Bluetooth speaker to review in my search for fun, interesting, and giftable tech.  The speaker comes double boxed with an outer branded brown cardboard box, a middle bubble wrap pocket, and an inner branded decorated slider box with display window. The slider box is a nice frame for the speaker\'s old timey look and makes it quite easy to gift with or without additional re-boxing.  The speaker is the size of a refrigerator magnet and measures 3" across and 2" up-down with a depth of 7/8" as measured to the tip of the control knob. The front-facing housing is a glossy colored plastic, and the overall weight is a scant 45 grams. Charging is via a USB-C port on the right side and the speaker will continue to operate normally even when plugged in and charging.  Connecting to and controlling the speaker is fairly simple and intuitive, especially as there is only the one USB-C charging port, two lights (one green status light and one power light backlighting the control knob), and one control knob for pairing, play/pause, and controlling the volume. Pressing down on the control knob will power up the speaker and turn on the backlight behind the control knob. Once powered on, the green status light will start blinking and a short string of Morse code will play. A long press of the control knob will initiate Bluetooth pairing whereupon the green status light turns solid, and another short string of Morse code will play. Once selected on your device, the speaker should already be set as the default AirPlay output so that turning the control knob will increase or decrease the volume and a short push of the control knob will play or pause the music stream. The control knob is not absolute and can be turned past 360 degrees.  The overall look of the sticker speaker is a clean old timey retro look complete with four horizontal (fake) openings simulating speaker grills, a glowing backlit control knob, and two smaller non-functional silver knobs. When powered off, the sticker speaker looks like your standard refrigerator magnet, and it\'s only the green status light that seems out of place and gives away the modern tech when powered on.  I have to admit that I was initially skeptical of the praise for the sound quality of this speaker, up until the point when I initially started playing the music on my device and spent a couple minutes checking my AirPlay settings before realizing that the sound was coming through the sticker speaker and not my device speakers. When properly magnetized to a flat metal surface, the sound is quite clean with a good dynamic range at normal listening levels. The sound is significantly at a lower volume and quality when not magnetized and/or when pressed against a non-metal surface - coming across muffled and with a narrower dynamic range. The requirement that the sticker speaker must be magnetized to a metal surface might be a limitation, but interestingly enough there were more magnet-friendly metal surfaces around the house than I realized, such as the oven, espresso machine, and a lot of cookie tins. What I especially like about this sticker speaker is that it\'s so tiny and fun to use, where you can just stick it on a vertical magnetic metal surface and start listening pretty quickly.  All in all, the MUZEN OTR sticker speaker is a nicely constructed piece of modern technology packaged behind a pleasant retro façade that speaks of simpler times. I would recommend this as a great option for a fun and pretty good quality Bluetooth speaker for use around the house on magnetic metal surfaces and/or as a gift for your technophile friend who seems to have everything.'
'B0BV6P3KSW','N/A','N/A','The media could not be loaded. Wow, even with glasses on I had a difficult time breathing the instructions in the little booklet that it came with so I ended up having to take pictures and blowing them up so that I could read the fine print. That was the most difficult thing with getting excited to work its well-made wait to it. I do wish that it came with the charger cord because I do not have a spare one so there’s that so if you’re going Wow, even with glasses on I had a difficult time breathing the instructions in the little booklet that it came with so I ended up having to take pictures and blowing them up so that I could read the fine print. That was the most difficult thing with getting this item to work it’s well-made it’s got a gun wait to it. I do wish that it came with the charger cord because I do not have a spare one so there’s that so if you’re going to get this, I do recommend it it’s not just a gimmick. It’s adequate speaker at work station that controls are absolutely adorable wash the bottom two are functional but the big main one is actually the volume is easy to use. I really like it a lot. I gave it 4 stars because who doesn’t include the power cord these days?!'
'B0BV6P3KSW','N/A','N/A',"I will explain what I meant by the end. Firstly sound quality is all over the place because everything reacts differently to audio. For me I love things that no one knows what they are. I mean who will assume this is your speaker lol. So far metal is the best. The reason I called this a tool is for my fellow voice actors. Instead of expensive audio testing equipment get this. Play the type of audio you plan on making into your proofing. It will show you how well it absorbs those frequencies. Plus I just love the magnet idea! Its easy to use upside down if you look at volume dial and cannot read on off then it's probably upside down. Makes a difference for sure. Pressing the main knob pauses and turning it left or right turns volume up and down respectively."
'B0BV6P3KSW','N/A','N/A','This makes a great small speaker. Slightly canned sound which is magnified if placed on thin metal. magnet works ok, but when volume is turned up, it walks itself down the fridge. Cute as a button though and I LOVE that the volume can be controlled on the speaker.'
'B0BV6P3KSW','N/A','N/A',"Not super clear sound but that doesn't bother me much because it adds an old time feel to the old time look of the radio. What does bother me is that it doesn't come with the cord needed to charge it. i feel that when a product is sold it should provide the consumer with everything necessary to use it. I also don't feel like it could handle a fall or two. I love the uniqueness of though."
'B0BV6P3KSW','N/A','N/A','These are SOOO cute and I love them. You need to know that they are designed to work being anchored to a surface like a refrigerator using the attached magnet. It bounces the sound against whatever surface it’s stuck to and that’s where you get the sound from. Connected immediately with no issues and the sound is remarkable for such a tiny little low-profile speaker. The cute factor is there. I love Muzen and have a few speakers from them I’ve used for years now and they are my go-to when I need to take something small and portable with me. Great battery life. These are a GREAT gift idea.'
'B0BV6P3KSW','N/A','N/A','When we tested this new speaker, which was sent to us for review via the Vine program, we were initially disappointed with the sound quality. We expected it to be not nearly as rich as the speakers we normally use to play music in our home. After all, it is tiny and out of the box sounded "tinny" and muted.  Then, we realized that the sound quality varies significantly, depending on where you place the speaker. We tried it on a metal railing and that improved things. We tried it on a metal door and that was better. Then we put it on the refrigerator and the bulk of that connection was the best of all.  So, if you do order one of these speakers, experiment with where you\'ll get the best results. The change in quality between surfaces surprised us.  Overall, though, we\'ve had better small speakers that cost less. At $30, we likely would not have purchased this speaker. And, we do know that some speakers we bought in the $20 range actually do perform better.  Perhaps you like the retro look of this speaker and might rate it at 5 stars for the colorful design, but for us this is a 4-star product.'
'B0BV6P3KSW','N/A','N/A','When I first pulled this little speaker out of the box, I powered it on, synched it to my smartphone via Bluetooth, and started playing music. With the speaker in my hand, I started tinkering with the volume, but no matter what I did the audio just ended up sounded muted and quiet. A bit disappointed, I decided to leave the music playing and test the strength of the magnet on my freezer door... and that\'s when this speaker started to shine!  The design of this speaker is unique in that it will not produce its full audio potential unless the speaker is attached to a metal surface. Once it is, the speaker is *impressively* loud for its size. While it does sound a bit "tinny" overall, I wouldn\'t expect a speaker this small of being capable of pushing mids and lows like its larger counterparts, especially at this price point. Additionally, that "tinny" nature actually goes well with the classic radio aesthetic of the speaker, which is kind of a cool complement, in my opinion.  After my initial tests with this speaker I decided to bring it out to my garage to listen to music while I cleaned up the space. After snapping it onto my garage fridge, I turned it up to around 80% volume and worked away. The music was clean and present while I worked away, with audio that could clearly be heard while sweeping, spraying down surfaces with a hose, and stacking lumber. Needless to say, it worked, and it worked well for the entire time I was working away.  Long story short - This little speaker is impressive in its ability to put out music. While the audio quality leaves something to be desired, you can\'t expect a speaker this compact to cover the full range of larger, higher end speakers. This speaker is easy to use, is small enough to fit just about anywhere one would want to place it, and it does a great job, overall. I\'m VERY impressed with this little unit! 5/5 stars!'
'B0BV6P3KSW','N/A','N/A',"I brought this for my girlfriend to stick on our refrigerator in our kitchen so she can listen to music while cooking. I didn't expect how good and loud it will sound, because it is so cute and small. But this speaker is amazing, don't be fooled by how it looks. It is so loud and the quality of its sound is absolutely fantastic."
'B0BV6P3KSW','N/A','N/A','The media could not be loaded. Great sound quality for the size. Clean sound with no distortion even at max volume. This is designed to be mounted on a metal surface for its full potential sound volume and quality. Very nice retro vibe design with today’s tech features. Good quality built and value.'
'B0BV6P3KSW','N/A','N/A',"I didn't pay enough attention, so i was shocked to see how tiny it is. but it's pretty cute. decent sound too."
'B0BV6P3KSW','N/A','N/A',"Everything depends on how much you value visual impact and retro design. Because this is not exactly what you'd want to use for music listening. Maybe for podcasts while you're chopping carrots in the kitchen? It's perfectly fine for spoken word.  But I must admit it brings a smile to my face every time I push the one functioning button to turn it on-- it emits a series of morse code tones. I almost expect to hear FDR or Eisenhower.  I forgot the price until it came time to review this little bluetooth speaker. Is it worth what they're asking? Well if you want good-to-excellent sound you can find some portable bluetooth speakers in the same rough price class. But if you have a niche for this-- or retro for you is priceless-- think of this as a refrigerator magnet that talks. And maybe it speaks to you.  UPDATE: The seller dropped the price by $10. I think that makes this a more realistic price. And I added a star.  UPDATE 2: I previously tried sticking this on the case of my desktop computer. But I finally broke down and violated my rule against refrigerator magnets. Boy I am I glad I did! The seller was not exaggerating about how this device was designed to use the surface it's attached to. I have to bring neighbors into the kitchen to guess where the sound is coming from. It sounds way bigger than it has any right to. (Still not much bass; let's not expect the impossible.) This is now boosted to 5 full stars."
'B0BV6P3KSW','N/A','N/A','This is like an old-fashioned radio for barbie—that size. It’s REALLY cute and the red color makes it POP.  It’s easy to operate—basic bluetooth operation and set up (no charging cable included but it’s a generic c type) and decent sound. The little dial on the radio lights up and acts as a volume control—that part is my favorite—when it lights up.  The only issue I have is the magnetization. It’s not a real hardcore magnet that really really sticks. It could be stronger because there’s a little rattle and distortion in the music that might be alleviated by a stronger magnetic hold on the surface.  Otherwise, I love it.'
'B0BV6P3KSW','N/A','N/A',"A magnet speaker? When I opened the package and saw how small this was, I thought for sure they forgot the speaker and just sent the magnet portion. I'm not going to sugarcoat it, this thing is incredibly overpriced for the size, regardless of how it performs. It's something you'd pick up at 5 Below as a stocking suffer, not a $40 speaker; there are thousands of better options in this price range.  Moving past that, it seems okay for what it is. The Bluetooth connected easily but when I played some music while holding it in my hand, I was shocked at how awfully tinny & distorted it sounded. Then I remembered the magnetic part. The speaker magnet is exposed on the back and when attached to a metal surface, it stabilizers the speaker and the sound quality and output increases dramatically. Don't get me wrong, it doesn't sound anything close to a standard Bluetooth speaker, but it's actually listenable. There's zero bass response, which is to be expected for a quarter sized speaker. It has audible distortion when you get into the upper volume range. It would be okay for podcasts and such, but not a lot beyond that.  Would I recommend that you buy this? Absolutely not, unless you can get it for $5. At $40 though, look at almost any other speaker, seriously."
'B0BV6P3KSW','N/A','N/A','Super tiny, and easy to set up. Great quality sound for its size. Would be great for the office. It holds a decent charge and stays connected to Bluetooth. When you turn it on it makes a tone that sounds like an old fashioned radio.'
'B0BV6P3KSW','N/A','N/A','I had previously ordered one of these MUZEN OTR Speakers in the color green, and liked it enough to get another one in red. The nostalgic well-constructed design of the speaker was well replicated and has proven to be a conversation piece among my friends. The clarity and sound level that this speaker produced was also impressive for this miniature device. Bluetooth connectivity was seamless, and the magnet’s adhesive property was strong – affixed to my refrigerator firmly. I loved the way the speaker’s dial lit up when turned on, and the ease of use; simply push the dial to turn on and off and the speaker charged relatively quickly, but I don’t know yet, how long the charge will hold.'
'B0BV6P3KSW','N/A','N/A',"The media could not be loaded. Disclaimer: I got this for free from the vine program. I don't get paid for the review I just recieve the item for free.  I normally listen to music while I cook or clean so I liked this speaker for the kitchen its cute small and has a pretty loud capacity for its size. Its not party loud but it's loud enough as long as it's magnetically attached to some metal part. Once you remove it it gets muffled a little. But I'm not going to be carrying it around so far so good."
'B0BV6P3KSW','N/A','N/A',"I'm really happy with this mini bluetooth speaker. No complaints!  Build quality is really nice on this speaker. The volume knob is easy to move and I like that there are individual clicks for each volume level. The nice orange glow really gives it a retro vibe and is a nice touch. The startup sound is cute, but I wish there was a way to turn it off so it didn't play every time.  The sound quality is decent and I've found that it sounds better attached to the small toaster oven I have rather than my refrigerator. The volume gets loud enough to jam out in the kitchen without it bleeding throughout the whole house. It does get a little distorted at full volume but that 50-75% is the sweet spot for me."
'B0BV6P3KSW','N/A','N/A','Tiny But mighty! Good sound for such a little speaker! So cute!'
'B0BV6P3KSW','N/A','N/A','These little speakers are cool. The retro look and the colors are very cool and the sound quality is descent considering it’s size. I have one for my grow room and one for the kitchen. Need to have something behind it or sound is compromised. I have one on the fridge and one on a metal cabinet in my grow. Just really cool little speakers and a fair price.'

'B0BV6P3KSW','N/A','N/A',"You can't expect much from a tiny speaker. That said, this does a fairly decent job of using the resonance of magnet to metal to amplify and deepen the sound. It came nicely packaged and the instructions were clear, although you don't need to know much to operate it. Just charge it, turn it on, use the Bluetooth setting on your phone to make sure you're connected, and play music. The kind of sound you get depends on what surface you attach it to. I went around the house and attached it to multiple surfaces. The top two were my toaster and my oven; the oven being the best. Being a mid-century modern fan, I really like the retro look of the speaker. I had assumed I would get a charging cord, but there wasn't one included. The port is a Type C port, and apparently, that's different than USB-C, because I had a bunch of USB-C charging cords that did not fit. Fortunately, I had a Type C and I was able to charge it. This will be a fun way to listen to my music pretty much any place without having to wear ear buds."
'B0BV6P3KSW','N/A','N/A','The media could not be loaded. This lil speaker is soooo cute. It plays without being on the refrigerator but once you put it on it plays louder that I expected. The dial works on it and it is so small and cute. Neat little speaker.'
'B0BV6P3KSW','N/A','N/A','I was extremely surprised to see the small, small size of this speaker. It is no bigger than a standard Credit Card. I really like it. An extremely vintage retro appeal. The Audio is quite good in view of the miniscule size (I have it attached to my refrigorator, and utilize it for listening to Podcasts). It charges by way of a USB C port. Moreover, though I am impressed with the unit, still I would find it very difficult to pay $39 for it in a local retail setting. I believe if anyone should see it in a retail store, the current price point would likely limit those who would ultimately purchase it. In my humble opinion, I feel a price of $19.99, or there about ($24.99 maximum), would create buyer enthusiasm. I do recommend the speaker in view of the good audio output (although sound for music output may not be satisfactory for some), and the compact, space saving characteristics, for those who are not dissuaded by the current price point. If willing to pay the price, I think most will be extremely happy with the speaker.'
'B0BV6P3KSW','N/A','N/A',"This thing is tiny, yet nice looking. It's very easy to pair with a Bluetooth Audio source. The Sound is not very loud, unless you attach it to a surface that can bounce back the audio. I was expecting this to be bigger and louder, based on the price. Manufacturer paid great attention to small details and construction quality. Overall I liked this tiny speaker, but it doesn't have enough punch to be heard in a noisy room, it's better suited for personal use in a quiet room."
'B0BV6P3KSW','N/A','N/A',"This is more of a novelty speaker than a full-blown, butt-kicking Bluetooth speaker, but it does work well when paired (easily) and it does stick where you place it, making it a nice little speaker to just connect to when you're in that place (wherever it may be: The bathroom wall is a handy spot!) and give you a bit of a boost from just using the phone's speaker. The radio design is cute, too.  Will it match some of the higher-priced speakers out there? Oh heck no. But it's inexpensive, simple to operate, and stays in place. Think of it as a speaker that becomes part of the room it's in, like a little extra for when you don't want to set up a full speaker system or lug a bigger portable speaker into your basement, bathroom, shed, laundry room, or other places where a more expensive speaker might be at risk. In that regard, it does a good job and is worth checking out! Five stars!"
'B0BV6P3KSW','N/A','N/A',"Positives: Sounds surprisingly great Has cool sound effects and lights that sound similar to the radio it's simulating Good battery life for how small it is Volume wheel is clicky and satisfying to use, and feels just like an older radio dial USB C  Negatives: None!  Notes: The magnet boosts the strength of the speaker, so ensure you attach it to a magnetic surface  Review: This is the coolest thing I've seen in a while. It looks a lot like an older-style radio of course, but for how tiny it is it sounds really great and clear! It can go quite loud too as at about 3/4 volume, it was loud enough to fill a room and was nearing uncomfortable levels.  Like I mentioned above, make sure you stick it to a magnetic surface! It's important for the audio quality and volume.  Highly recommended for anyone looking for a unique but good sounding speaker for their kitchen!"
'B0BV6P3KSW','N/A','N/A','I knew that this was small when I ordered it but was kinda shocked when I opened up the package. It’s not necessarily too small but it’s thin too. It’s got the old school charm and the light up dial is a nice touch. It only has the one button/dial that does everything but that’s all you really need. It charges with a c type plug and pairs easily with your phone. When applied to your magnetic source the sounds amplify quite well. You’re not going to get any real bass from this device but the sound is there and for the size it’s pretty impressive. So if you’re looking for something easy and absolutely adorable for your kitchen or office this is perfect. This would be great as a gift option or just a gift for yourself.'
'B0BV6P3KSW','N/A','N/A',"Cute.  I started with a small Toyo box as a metallic base. Startling results. The box resonates well...especially so when latched. I could hear some buzzing and saw the box was not latched and simply latching the box made a big difference. I also placed the speaker inside the box and closed it, but I think the signal was easily blocked. Placed on the fully open lid, the sound was thin...almost as thin as not attached to anything metal.  Other locations tested: The clothes washer lid and front was pretty good. Dryer, file cabinet, refrigerator and work bench rounded out the rankings. But wait! I have another Toyo box that is about 3 times the volume of this box. It gave a lesser performance. I also tried a Traumwesen stainless steel lunch box (which is non-magnetic) with non-stellar results.  The small-box/speaker combination is the most portable and visually appealing.  I like the retro look and I'm satisfied with the sound for the size."
'B0BV6P3KSW','N/A','N/A','This speaker is SO CUTE! It also puts off an impressive amount of sound. The little circle piece on the back is actually the speaker, because of that you get different audio sounds depending on where you place it. It’s hard to describe but the audio sounds different when I placed it on my granite counter top, wood surface, refrigerator, couch cushions, a metal pipe, in a bowl, etc. It’s actually really cool to play around with the different audio you can get. So far I liked the refrigerator the best, but I have to put it on the side since the front panels of my fridge aren’t magnetic. It connected to my phone very easily, it just connects via Bluetooth and showed up very quickly in the list of available connections; no crazy hoops to jump through to get it connected.  Overall I love this little speaker. It’s adorable and has great sound output, quality is dependent on where you put it.'
