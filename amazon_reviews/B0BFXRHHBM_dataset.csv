'B0BFXRHHBM','Must buy','4.0 out of 5 stars','A top class product & must say it‚Äôs worth more.'
'B0BFXRHHBM','Bad experience','1.0 out of 5 stars',"I would like to start by saying the item itself is not bad. It's a low quality keyboard for sure but very usable and decent enough. But the packaging was horrible which lead to damaged item. I do not have time to wait for another whole week to wait for replacement so I had to accept the item condition as it is."
'B0BFXRHHBM','Velue for money','5.0 out of 5 stars','Too good'
'B0BFXRHHBM',"I don't think its Value for money.",'3.0 out of 5 stars','Right Shift key feels hard when you press it with your little finger during typing. Go for another brand in this range.'
'B0BFXRHHBM','Overall Quality','3.0 out of 5 stars','Cheap looking. Strong plastic odor. You get what you pay for. Sloppy packing and Slow shipping. The shipping box used was a lot bigger than the actual keyboard box . With NO filler material the actual content was getting tossed inside the shipping box. However, no damage to the keyboard. The number-lock and Cap-lock lights are hidden deep below that they serve no purpose - poor design. Works fine now. Will have to see how long it would serve. If you want a sturdy one for a long time use then look for something else.'

'B0BFXRHHBM','Too good but....','4.0 out of 5 stars',"I bought it for Rs.230. At this price point, the quality of the keyboard is really good. It is very lightweight. The keystrokes are silent enough. One major drawback of this product is that it doesn't have multi-media function keys. Anyhow what more to expect at this price? Personally, I liked it!"
