'B07WVZX54X','Do not buy','1.0 out of 5 stars','Do not buy this item else you will end up buying the telescopic handle every 3 to 4 months. Telescopic handle price is 350, whose lock gets broken very easily.  Cloth is good but product is not durable at all due to plastic made telescopic handle.'

The Telescopic Handle is VERY easy to draw and once reinserted - the Mop can simply be hung in the bathroom 3) Unlike MOST Mops, this is easy to WASH and SQUEEZE too ABSOLUTELY LOVE this Product Just Go For It !!!!'
'B07WVZX54X','Money making scam','1.0 out of 5 stars','I would like to inform Amazon to remove this product from your list as it’s a not user friendly product. For my surprise , the telescopic handle broke into pieces during first use. They did telescopic handle not for user convenience, it’s just for their ease of transport.'
'B07WVZX54X','Excellent product','5.0 out of 5 stars','Value for money, excellent product'
'B07WVZX54X','Handle broke after only few months of use','3.0 out of 5 stars','This mop is light and cleans well, but the handle broke after less than four months of use. It is too flimsy for such an expensive mop.'
'B07WVZX54X','Do not buy','1.0 out of 5 stars','Pathetic , within just 2uses the cloth started tearing apart'
'B07WVZX54X','Light weight mop','5.0 out of 5 stars','Excellent product'
'B07WVZX54X','Not very much useful.','3.0 out of 5 stars','It doesn’t soak water completely. It leaves a film of water strain. I don’t think it is made of microfibres. The microfibres may be fitted in a flat holder so that required pressure may be inserted while wiping.'

'B07WVZX54X','Not worth the money','4.0 out of 5 stars','Not what I expected from the image'
'B07WVZX54X','Best mop in town','5.0 out of 5 stars','Light weight yet sturdy. The secret is the micro fibre strips. Very easy to squeeze out. Great for small floor areas. We use it in the kitchen. A bit small for the whole house though. One drawback though; no hands free squeezer! You have to use hands.'
'B07WVZX54X','Very useful','5.0 out of 5 stars','Very useful'
'B07WVZX54X','No value for money....looks fancy no utility solved','2.0 out of 5 stars','The product has very less cloth attached to the stick for mopping so the hard part gets rubbed with the floor while mopping its a bad product only suitable for light mopping.'
'B07WVZX54X','Adjustable not working','1.0 out of 5 stars','Used the product only once and the handle is broken. Not usable at all. Waste of money'
'B07WVZX54X','No spares available','2.0 out of 5 stars','Wrong of maker to not provide spare heads for this mop.'
'B07WVZX54X','Go for it','5.0 out of 5 stars','Good'
'B07WVZX54X','Not user friendly','1.0 out of 5 stars','When I bought it from metro CC, they promised to provide mop refill as a spare parts in future. Later on I have visited almost 6 different supermarkets, looking for a refills, then I realised it’s a business case not to sell as a spare parts. When I bought it in Amazon(full set), soon after 3 days , it’s broke . More details in pics attached. This is a scam. So be aware before you buy.'

'B07WVZX54X','Excellent product!','5.0 out of 5 stars','I usually mop my floor after vacuuming it. This mop is super easy to use. Light weight and a long handle makes mopping a breeze. It can reach any corner. Bought it just before lockdown. I am glad I did so. Post vacuuming my 3 bhk flat takes 15 min to mop. Being lightweight it is easy to use. One can mop very fast.'
