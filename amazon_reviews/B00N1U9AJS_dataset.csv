'B00N1U9AJS','Useless tape - Save your money','1.0 out of 5 stars','Bought the tape based on the 3M brand name to stick it to a soap case to the bathroom tile after cleaning both surfaces. After a few hours, the tape just came out. I tried again and same thing. You can check that the double sided tape is not much sticky from the simple fact that when I opened the tape, you can touch it with your hands and it barely stuck to my hand. Save your money since you cannot return it but only exchange a piece of garbage with another garbage.'
