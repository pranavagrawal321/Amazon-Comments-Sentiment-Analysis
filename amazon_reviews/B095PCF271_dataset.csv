'B095PCF271','Good purchase','4.0 out of 5 stars',"Build quality good enough for eighteen liters capacity bucket and feels sturdy while using it. Price is also decent as per the price point and how long it will last depend on its usage that's obvious. Not sure of being food grade so I use it for water storage purpose of daily misllenous needs."
