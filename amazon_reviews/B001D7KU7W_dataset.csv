'B001D7KU7W','It works!!!!!!!!','5.0 out of 5 stars','So basically I was trying to repaste my laptop and one of the heatsink screws got stripped (size M2x3).. I tried a lot of things.. elastic band.. soldering something to it etc.. but no luck.. Then I came across this and in 30 seconds the screw was out!! I really didnt have much hopes but this worked wonders.. It is expensive, but it will do what it says..'

'B001D7KU7W','N/A','N/A',"I bought this as I had a stripped M.2 screw holding a SSD in place and I needed it removed. This did the trick after I had tried a few things without success. This is a great tool to have on hand and I'm happy to have it available to use now."

'B001D7KU7W','N/A','N/A',"I don't usually write product reviews but I just had to leave a review for this tool. One of the screws.on the print head of my 3D printer was completely stuck and I could not remove it no matter what I did and whatever tool I used. I spent an entire night trying to get that screw out to no avail. I was completely at my wits end until somehow I stumbled upon this magic invention. Patience is not my forte so waiting the 2 day for it to reach me was the hardest part but once it got here, I took one look at it and was sure it will end up being a disappointment just like all the other suggestions (rubber band, super glue blah blah). To my astonishment, this met the screw, took it by its head and turned it in one go. And the rest is history. I am so happy to have found this. If you are in a similar jam, don't hesitate - this will work as described. It worked for me and I am so happy."

'B001D7KU7W','N/A','N/A',"I had 2 badly stripped m.2 screws on my laptop that stopped me from adding another nvme drive. On top of that, one of the screw was not only stripper, but stuck on so tight. I had tried literally everything!. MY only last choices were to drill the small screw, which was dangerous so i didn't want to do, or pay a computer repair store money just to remove 2 m.2 screws which were not only a waste of money, i didn't know how they you actually remove the screws, the might drill it too, which i didn't want to do in the first place.  I tried every other methods except for the last 2 which were risky, but then i stumbled upon this screwdriver from an ifixit guide. i decided to give it a try and OMG, THIS SAVED MY LIFE. Worth paid for itself in the first go. CAnnot believe it was able to remove my badly stripped and stuck/tight m.2 screws. the grip is amazing!!! GET THIS."

'B001D7KU7W','N/A','N/A','These are priced more reasonably than similar gripping pliers from a specialty luthier supplier. I use them to remove screws/bolts with stripped heads that I used to drill out to remove. Easier and faster.'

'B001D7KU7W','N/A','N/A','The tool works exceptionally well for the one reason it was made for. My m.2ssd screw was completely stripped, i tried loads of screw drivers and sizes, rubber band, tape, superglue and normal needle nose pliers. This made quick work of the situation. A bit pricey but if it works it works. Also i am not too sure what the ESD claim here is.'
'B001D7KU7W','N/A','N/A',"I had a stripped m2 screw that was pre-installed on a mobo for a 2280 expansion slot. The technician building it decided to use loctite to fasten a screw on an empty slot! I appreciate them including one as these are normally not included but why would you secure a screw on an unused slot? Anyways, everything I tried just stripped the screw until it was unusable with a traditional screwdriver. I thought I'd had to result to dangerous methods to get it off, but this tool worked perfectly, even on a hard to grip flat m2 screw. Totally worth the import fees. Japanese quality."

'B001D7KU7W','N/A','N/A','These were exactly what I needed to remove two cheap screws where the heads had torqued off leaving them deep in the wood. Chiselled a 2mm groove around the screw and these were able to grip it well enough to rotate it out. Perfect, quality tool, and the packaging is cute too.'
'B001D7KU7W','N/A','N/A',"Look, if you have a stripped screw preventing you from removing your hard drive, just get this. Don't even bother with the rubber band/hot glue/drill trick unless you just don't give a damn anymore. This one screw was getting on my last nerve trying everything under the sun short of a drill and then I bought this. And voila, the screw and hard drive were both out in a minute. Pain. A good purchase."
'B001D7KU7W','N/A','N/A','Stripped the screw when trying to upgrade my NVME. I tried all of the online methods, rubber bands, latex gloves, etc. None of them worked. Finally decided to get this tool as a last ditch effort. It took a firm grip on the screw head but I was able to get the screw out. I will definitely be keeping this in my toolkit.'

'B001D7KU7W','N/A','N/A',"Recently, I was trying to remove a Phillips head M2 screw that was holding in a 2280 SSD in a Lenovo IdeaPad FLEX-15IWL laptop. The screw head had been covered by a manufacturer warranty sticker that was a few years old and almost impossible to remove completely. Residual material from the sticker made it difficult for the screwdriver to get a grip. Tried the rubber band workaround to no avail, and I didn't want to risk the superglue and drill approaches. Called a local PC repair shop, and they advised against removing the screw because of the risk. Found some references to these pliers online and decided to give them a try. They worked as advertised. The shape of the head and the special serration on the interior makes it possible to get a grip even in a tight place. Would recommend them to anyone who does computer repairs and upgrades."

'B001D7KU7W','N/A','N/A','These are great. They grip stubborn stripped screws almost as if you were using a regular screwdriver on an unstripped screw. Work better than I expected. Just be careful when grabbing ahold of screws that are still flush against the surface.'
'B001D7KU7W','N/A','N/A',"I found this product after discovering Vampliers (American brand) which are produced in Japan - these are the exact same but with the benefit of being significantly cheaper.  My PS5 M.2 screw would not budge when using my precision screwdriver and led to it becoming stripped. Until I found these I was worried that I would have to get a screw extraction tool to get it out and possibly damage my system.  Once I got these however the screw was loosened within a quarter turn and came out fine with the screwdriver and the original screw went back in fine after I installed the M.2.  Although I don't expect I'll use these often they did the job and I'm very happy with my purchase."

'B001D7KU7W','N/A','N/A',"Japanese-made import. Did great on two rounded-off flathead screws when all other methods on the internet failed – rubber band, superglued-in screwdriver tip, using Dremel type tool to cut a groove into the screw face for a flat bladed screwdriver etc (which was unsuccessful as its height was less than 1mm).  Squeeze the handles only tightly enough to stop the pliars slipping both around and off the problem screw. And initially it is best to rotate by a few degrees in a controlled manner, as despite the steel construction the contacting ridges on the jaws are necessarily shallow for gripping the outside edges of very small diameter screwheads. Consequently they can be deformed out of shape permanently if too much pressure is applied. A previous reviewer recommended tapping the screw's face if practical to help unstick threads (which I did), applying a light penetrating fluid if rusted or particularly tight is also an idea.  Were it allowed, half a star could be knocked off for the seemingly high price of these small pliers, yet it is clearly a specialist tool. 5 stars is definitely justified however when factoring in its high quality Japanese construction, comfortable-to-hold esd-safe handles if you have average sized hands and most of all, the relief of getting out of what are highly frustrating, near impossible situations! I could not find a similar product from another manufacturer. Who knows, maybe thanks to the UK-Japan trade deal signed around 12 months ago these and Engineer's other products will eventually cost less."

'B001D7KU7W','N/A','N/A','I was having very bleak and negative feelings because a tiny screw was completely stripped in a small confined space on an expensive electronic device. There was probably only a couple millimeters at most between the screw and the wall of the device which meant almost nothing could even grab the screw without being blocked by the wall. This not only was able to fit in the crevice to touch the screw, it also managed to hold on to the screw while I twisted hard (it was a heavily over-torqued screw) and I experienced a euphoria when the screw was finally removed. Very nice product.'

'B001D7KU7W','N/A','N/A','Die Zange darf in im EDV-Bereich nicht fehlen. Gerade wenn der Hersteller die Schrauben so fest anzieht dass man sie nicht mal mit dem mitgelieferten Schraubendreher auf bekommt. Musste die M2 Schraube von der Festplatte lösen. Dafür ist diese Zange genau richtig. Es gibt ja noch größere von denen. Aber wer auch so ein Problem hat sollte die kaufen lohnt sich wirklich. überlege schon ob ich die anderen zwei auch kaufe.'
