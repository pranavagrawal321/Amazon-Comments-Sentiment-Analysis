'B0C93QX5QM','Best Budget Laptop with lots of great spec!','5.0 out of 5 stars',"This Acer inspire lite model (i5 11th gen) is a great value for money product. It has sp many spec like 16 GB ram (expandable) , 512 GB SSD (expandable), intel i5 11th gen processor. A laptop with all these specs cost more than 50k (you can compare it with other brands like HP, LENOVA, DELL, etc - you'll find that this laptop is the option under 40k with all these specs. I have been using this laptop from last 5 days and I am really happy with the laptop's quality.  Pros: - Great build quality (Metal alloy body) - Good processor (i5 11th gen) - FHD screen - budget friendly -180¬∞ hinge - dual storage capable (SSD + HDD) - Good battery backup - C type port  Cons: - No backlight keyboard - No Camera privacy shutter - Okish Sound quality  Great for students and working professionals with normal to medium level usage. All in all it's a great product!"
'B0C93QX5QM','WE ORDERED LAPTOP SEEING ALL FEATURES and looked good','3.0 out of 5 stars',"This laptop we ordered in exchange for our present working Dell laptop. WE ORDERED LAPTOP SEEING ALL FEATURES and looked good but totally disappointed with Amazon delivery team. We have been following up for delivery since morning but the agent came in an auto that too after 7pm and was extreme hurry to leave. He didn't check our laptop for exchange, he said some other technical guy Aneesh will come for pick up and delivery tomorrow morning and quickly left without seeing anything, later he cancelled our order. Totally shocked to see his behaviour. Will share feedback with customer care services too. We are never going to buy exchange stuffs from Amazon as so unprofessional team. Kindly take the feedback so other customers do not suffer ."
