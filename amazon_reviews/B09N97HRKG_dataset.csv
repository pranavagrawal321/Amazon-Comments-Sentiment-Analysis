'B09N97HRKG',"This is an excellent men's waist belt, no regret in buying it.",'5.0 out of 5 stars','The media could not be loaded. Buckle is very good. I don\'t even need grooves for tightening. However there is a bit difficulty to fit in wearing because the belt is too long for me. My waist is 32". So those whose waist sizes are bigger wont have to shorten it, and those whose waists are small will certainly have to cut it shorter. The price is high at above 1k but the belt seems to last very long. I have uploaded the video and the photo after wearing for more than 2 weeks.'
'B09N97HRKG','NOT Genuine. NOT Leather','2.0 out of 5 stars','The product is not genuine leather. It is a rubber belt. Super soft and easy to wear off and cut. The belt clearly does not has long life and is too expensive. In this price you can get a much better and branded belt. I gave 2 stars just for the buckel as it looks good. Thats the only positive.  I am not sure why sellers have to lie. He/she could have sold it as a non leather belt as well and keeping the price right.'
