'B0792T43TC','Rubbish packaging - sid eopening thin plastic rather than cardboard box','1.0 out of 5 stars','So tissue quality is ok just like other tissues The product used to come in good cardboard box where only 1 tissue could be pulled out from the top, but now the company is saving money on the cardboard packaging. I ordered pack of 3 and all came with non cardboard box but just a think ploy plastic, where you have to pull the tissue from sides and it would just not be difficult but unnecessarily multiple tissues come out (more usage ??). Dont know where the company though they could save money by doing this and where we are all thinking of scrapping plastic material, the company introduces more plastic in use.'

'B0792T43TC','A soft and gentle tissue pack for your daily needs','5.0 out of 5 stars','I have been using the Presto! 2 Ply Facial Tissue Soft Pack for a long time, and I am very satisfied with its quality and convenience. This tissue pack is very soft and gentle, as it is made from 100% natural virgin paper. It has a 2 ply thickness, which makes it strong and absorbent. It is also dermatologically tested, which means it is safe and hygienic for my skin. It is very convenient, as it comes in a soft pack that can be easily opened and closed. It has 200 pulls per pack, which is enough for my daily needs. It can be used for various purposes, such as wiping my face, nose, hands, or any other surface. It is also very versatile, as it can be carried in my bag, car, or kept at home or office. It is also very affordable, compared to other tissue packs in the market. I would highly recommend this tissue pack to anyone who wants a soft and gentle tissue pack for their daily needs. It is a great product from Presto!'
