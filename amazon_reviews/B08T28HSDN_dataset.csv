'B08T28HSDN','Not worth','1.0 out of 5 stars','Except the fact it is mechanical keyboard, nothing else is good. You can get reddragon shiva keyboard which has RGB and lesser price.'
'B08T28HSDN','Value for money','5.0 out of 5 stars','A wired mechanical keyboard with all features'
'B08T28HSDN','Not a long term keyboard','3.0 out of 5 stars',"starting months were excellent but after months I began noticing keys getting missed while typing the same in-game, at first I ignored as it was only with 1 key but then it became worse as from one it is happening with 12 keys which either not working or had press multiple times to get it register.  I raised the issue and had specifically mentioned the keys in which the issue was happening but they didn't even bother to verify that and returned the keyboard the same day they received to check.  Also, they don't have any dedicated service centre, they provide service via Boat Service centre.  If you want a long-term purchase then this is not for you, i am now buying a new keyboard and that will surely not going to be from readgear"
'B08T28HSDN','not worth the cost one pay for a mechanical keyboard','1.0 out of 5 stars','It works well for an year then starts malfunction keys and just goes useless. this is a rebranded one and finding a service for this is not an easy deal…so not worth the cost one pay for a mechanical keyboard of this sort..'
'B08T28HSDN','Good budget keyboard for a year.','3.0 out of 5 stars','They keys, actuation, palm rest is all good. Few days in, I couldn\'t type without it. Easy to get used to and does provide that click feel.  It all lasted for just over a year. Not sure what\'s the issue but, I started getting misclicks.... It\'d register a "0" when I hit space bar, open the calculator when I hit right arrow, enter a "&" when pressing alt and so on... Its essentially useless for me no, a year later.'
'B08T28HSDN','Good quality and durable look are also good','5.0 out of 5 stars','Price is higher'
'B08T28HSDN','Poor quality keyboard','1.0 out of 5 stars',"Keyboard quality is very bad. Keys are lighting up after 3-4 months. Some time keys also stops responding. I have already replaced my laptop 2 time in a span of 1 year but still not satisfied with the product. Keep safe your money and invest in good product. Just leaves this one. Whenever i clean the keyboard after some times its giving me a problem. Pls don't think that i don't know how to clean up a keyboard. It's just some issue with the keyboard."

'B08T28HSDN','In just 4 months keys have stopped working','1.0 out of 5 stars','there are many other cheap mechanical keyboards in the market guys. Dont buy this one. Its not been 4 months completely and certain keys have stopped working.'
'B08T28HSDN','Awesome value for money','5.0 out of 5 stars','The media could not be loaded. Awesome keyboard with buttery smooth keys. This is my first mechanical keyboard. And i am not a professional gamer, using it for coding. I feel like my typing speed has been increased with this keyboard. I Like the keystrokes sound of blue switches. It comes with all shortcuts on functional keys also the volume knob gives rich look to it. Lighting is more than enough to make it look crazy. You will get plenty of preset lighting animations. You can install the software to control many more things. It’s ergonomically designed to give you comfort while typing. It comes with wrist rest. This keyboard weighs more than a kilo with metallic body. Overall superb keyboard must try of your budget is under 2500 Rps.'
'B08T28HSDN','Key failure','1.0 out of 5 stars',"It has only been four months after the purchase and already the 'A' key has failed.

'B08T28HSDN','Disappointed with the build quality','3.0 out of 5 stars','First, the keyboard had the faulty shift key, got the replacement but within a month, one of the key\'s RGB stopped working... And the support is worst, you\'ll find it utterly difficult to contact the support. The company BOAT is actually taking care of redgear support, its so confusing.  Update: They checked the product and rejected my claim saying, "NO ISSUE FOUND" and returned the same faulty rgb keyboard. Coustomer support is very important. Try to avoid this keyboard.'

'B08T28HSDN','Exceeded my expectations in every aspect','5.0 out of 5 stars','I purchased this Mechanical Keyboard three months ago, and I must say, it has exceeded my expectations in every aspect. From performance to design, this keyboard has truly won me over.  Performance and Key Press: The keypress on the Redgear Shadow Blade is exceptional. The mechanical switches provide a satisfying tactile feedback, and each keypress feels precise and responsive. The clicky sound adds to the overall typing experience, making it not only functional but also enjoyable.  Durability and Reliability: After three months of regular usage, the keyboard still functions flawlessly. The build quality is impressive, and it seems like it can endure prolonged use without any signs of wear and tear. The keys are sturdy and show no signs of fading or loss of functionality.  Design and Aesthetics: The sleek design of the keyboard adds a touch of sophistication to my workspace. The RGB backlighting not only looks great but also enhances visibility in dimly lit environments. The keys are well-spaced and ergonomic, making long typing sessions comfortable and efficient.  Cons: After extensive use, I have yet to come across any significant drawbacks or cons with the this Mechanical Keyboard. It has truly proven to be a reliable companion for both work and gaming, offering a seamless experience without any noticeable downsides.'
