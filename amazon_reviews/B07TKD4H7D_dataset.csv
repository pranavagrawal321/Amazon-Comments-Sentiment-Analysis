'B07TKD4H7D','Average cloth quality ,size issues','2.0 out of 5 stars',"The Inkast Denim Co. shirt you purchased for 499 seems to have some issues with size and cloth quality. While the price may seem reasonable, it's important to note that quality should not be sacrificed for affordability.  Regarding the sizing issue, it can be frustrating to receive a garment that doesn't fit properly. It's unclear from your statement whether the shirt was too big or too small, but either way, it's important to ensure that clothing fits well to be comfortable and flattering. It's possible that the brand's sizing chart is not accurate, or that the shirt was made inconsistently.  As for the cloth quality, it's disappointing to hear that it was only average. Without more specific details, it's hard to say exactly what the issue was, but it could be that the fabric was thin or prone to wrinkling. A shirt that doesn't hold up well after washing or wears out quickly is not a good value in the long run.  Overall, it seems that the Inkast Denim Co. shirt you purchased had some significant drawbacks. While the price point may have been attractive, it's important to consider factors like fit and quality before making a purchase."
