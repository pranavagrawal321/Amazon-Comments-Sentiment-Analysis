'B07NBWT3Z2','Not good in terms of battery backup.','3.0 out of 5 stars',"The media could not be loaded. I am writing this review after using this product for approx 1.5 year. Currently, I am getting at most 3 hours of battery backup. It's iron body gets corrosion just after 5 months. I added pictures and videos of how it looks now. It's looks very bad now. Not recommended. It will be good in between 1400-1500. The sound quality is good. On full volume battery backup will be only 2 hrs max after charging it for 3 to 4 hrs. It will take 4 hrs to full charge which will last to only 3-4 hrs.  Not good in terms of battery backup."

'B07NBWT3Z2','Awesome sound quality and loudness!','5.0 out of 5 stars',"I've been using this speaker for quite some time now. I have to admit that I've not felt any issues with this speaker at all. The sound quality is superb and it's plenty loud too. The only problem I can say(which is not actually a problem) is that the black color becomes a little rusty over time...it still doesn't affect the sound tho, so it's fine... it's just a minor appearance issue. But if you can overlook this, then this speaker is the best damn speaker in this range!"
