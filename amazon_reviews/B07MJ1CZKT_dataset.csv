'B07MJ1CZKT','The light is not lighting','1.0 out of 5 stars','It\'s only been a week since this light got delivered from Amazon, and I must say it has been a complete letdown. The product description touted its "bright and efficient illumination," but in reality, the light emitted is barely sufficient to illuminate a small corner of the room. The build quality is subpar, with flimsy materials that make the whole thing feel like it\'s about to fall apart any second. To add insult to injury, the installation process was a nightmare, as the instructions provided were vague and confusing. It\'s frustrating to spend money on a product that not only fails to meet its advertised claims but also causes unnecessary hassle. Save your money and look elsewhere for a better lighting solution.'

'B07MJ1CZKT','Nice for decoration for those who likes bees.','4.0 out of 5 stars','Nice product. But somewhat delicate as the wires are delicate. Lits with 3x AAA batteries. Cons: not having USB socket. Works Only with batteries.'
'B07MJ1CZKT','Thankyou for the quick replacement but not a permanent product','4.0 out of 5 stars','The lights were replaced the same day after placing replacement request. It is in working condition.  UPDATE AFTER 15 day usage (in home temple) The brightness of the light was fine for first 3-5 days but then within a week it got dimmed to absolutely low. It might be because of continued usage in night. I would not recommend to buy if you‚Äôre using it to light up places like home temple or headboards etc or for longer duration purposes.'
'B07MJ1CZKT','Adorable little bee lights, cute and attractive','5.0 out of 5 stars','Adorable small bee lights, the orange bee body gives a bright orange glow, good length. Lights work with 3 AA batteries. Box of the light is a tad bit flimsy, have to handle with care'
