The box is huge and the locking flaps are quite strong enough and will last for a long time with normal usage. The plastic quality is also good. If you use it in a rough way then obviously it's gonna break. Overall worth the price."

'B0733564V9','PROBABLY NOT FULLY AIRTIGHT','3.0 out of 5 stars','NOT TOO BAD, BUT FOR MY CASE ONE CLIP IS LOOSE. IF YOU ARE PLANING TO PUT YOUR CAMERA IN IT AS DRY BOX, IN MY EXPERIENCE IT MAY NOT BE GOOD CHOICE. I PUT MY CAMERA WITH LENS MOUNT, CAMERA IS NOT COMPLETELY TOUCH THE INSIDE SURFACE IT IS IN HANG POSITION BECAUSE THE SHAPE IS NOT SQUARE. ITS TUMBLER OR MUG TYPE. I USE A HUMIDITY METER AND AFTER FEW DAYS IT IS AUTOMATICALLY INCREASING FEW PERCENTAGE. SO MAYBE IT IS NOT FULLY AIR TIGHT.  PLASTIC QUALITY IS GOOD.'
