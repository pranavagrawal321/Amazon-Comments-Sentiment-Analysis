'B0C4622G6N','Whatsapp, PDF etc. are very slow to load','3.0 out of 5 stars',"Pros: Battery life is good. Battery charges fast. Phone doesn't hang. Camera is good. Cons: When you speak with speaker on, the other party is not able to hear your voice clearly on many occasions. Also, Whatsapp images, PDF file, and Videos are extremely slow to load. UI interface is not very intuitive as image files get stored at different locations depending upon how you got the images (from Whataspp, through camera or any other means)."
