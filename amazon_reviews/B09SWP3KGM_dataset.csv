'B09SWP3KGM','Amazingü§é','5.0 out of 5 stars',"Swiss Beauty Pop Eyeliner in Purple  I recently tried the Swiss Beauty Pop Eyeliner in the Purple shade, and I must say, it's a fun addition to my makeup collection!  The first thing that caught my attention was its cute color. Once applied, it stays put throughout the day without fading. I've worn it for hours without any touch-ups, and it still looked as vibrant as when I first applied it.  The eyeliner is also easy to remove, which is a relief. It comes off cleanly with makeup remover, so you won't have to rub your eyes vigorously.  It's affordable, high-quality. I've received compliments every time I've worn it, and it has quickly become one of my favorite makeup products."

'B09SWP3KGM','Nice color but...','3.0 out of 5 stars',"Purchased this item in May 2023 and since then I have used and disposed of it as well. 1. Nice and compact eyeliner. It barely occupies space amidst so many of your cosmetics 2. The color brown looked good on my eyelid. It didn't stand out coz of its shade. It blended in well with the eyelid texture 3. The brush quality is good 4. For the price I got it was good value but...  Unfortunately, the liquid dried up really quickly and was left unusable. This isn't the case with my other brand of eyeliner which is still wet after so many months of usage. That was disappointing.  The seller was RK World Infocom Ltd & an Amazon-fulfilled service."
