'B0C8MTWMK2','Good product for office use and entertainment.','5.0 out of 5 stars',"Pro: 1. Image and video quality is very good( in i5 3570 processor,HDMI). 2. Pixels are ok. 3. Good for office use. 4. Good looking and good build quality. 5. Good text view.  Cons: 1. Brightness is very high. At 0 brightness with 0 contrast the screen seems normal. 2. No sound system. 3. Eye comfort did not work for me.  Conclusion: Good image quality product. Use it for seeing movies, pictures, normal office tasks. If you want best picture quality then use a good graphic card and a good processor (i5,i7). In this price range don't expect sAMOLED display."

'B0C8MTWMK2','The display looks promising, I hope Samsung‚Äôs service doesn‚Äôt fail on me in the future though.','4.0 out of 5 stars','The media could not be loaded. Colors are accurate, screen is bright enough and 75hz is the perfect spot for me. So far no complains, just hope Samsung‚Äôs customer care doesn‚Äôt fail on me in case something goes wrong with the product. Worth for its price, recommended for programmers, media consumers and some non-competitive gaming.'

'B0C8MTWMK2','4.5/5 - recommend to buy','5.0 out of 5 stars','The media could not be loaded. If you are looking for a monitor in budget this is the one. I bought it for 8.6k. I bought this for office use and casual gaming, suits well for both. I have no cons as such for this monitor. At this price it provides 1 hdmi, 1 vga, and power port and a more than average HD display at 75hz. BUT, If you have a higher budget go for a monitor which has maybe 2 hdmi ports if you plan to connect 2 devices and maybe a higher refresh rate otherview at this price this one offers good performance. Blindly go ahead and purchase this If your budget is under 10k. THANKSüòÑ'

'B0C8MTWMK2','Worst Product , Failed','1.0 out of 5 stars','This is the worst monitor. Display is gone with lines within 13 months of usage. Samsung denied the warranty by giving some stupid reasons.

Don‚Äôt waste 13000 on this useless monitor. Terrible disappointment .'

'B0C8MTWMK2',"Ideal monitor for the price. However the tilt functionality was hard to figure out but it's there.",'4.0 out of 5 stars',"The media could not be loaded. I bought the 2020 model, and for 2 years I believed the monitor was incapable of tilting. But if you remove the black tape shown in the image I've attached, there will be two screws. Slightly unscrew both of them to unlock the tilt functionality, as shown in the video I've attached.  All other aspects of this monitor are too good for the price. Worth every penny, no regrets. Samsung delivers."
'B0C8MTWMK2','Disappointing with Plastic Body Build Quality','3.0 out of 5 stars',"While the display is impressive, I'm disappointed with the plastic body build quality. It feels cheap and resembles a hastily printed 3rd-tier product. A letdown, considering the potential of the display."
'B0C8MTWMK2','Not happy with the seller','3.0 out of 5 stars',"The screen works fine. But I think there's an issue with the seller. There were no instructions on how to set up the stand and I think it was broken as well.  Because I cannot change the orientation of the screen. It's fixed in one place after screwing in the stand but I can that it has been tampered with."
