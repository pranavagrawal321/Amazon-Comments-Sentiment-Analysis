'B0769HL9DL','Good for storage','5.0 out of 5 stars',"Quite good space for storing all the tools, the tray and top 4 square gives some more additional space and quick access or segregation on tools. Good to have one incase if you don't have an separate space. I opted for 19 inches. The only itching thing is price, slightly more."
'B0769HL9DL','All PTB-19 are the same size','4.0 out of 5 stars','Dimensions mentioned by different vendors vary and they price according to the size they mention, do not believe in it, all PTB-19 size are the same from any vendors, they all 19 inches. So go for the cheapest.'

'B0769HL9DL','Sturdy Tool Box','5.0 out of 5 stars',"Taparia brand has long standing brand value in the hand tools market in India. That's why when I thought that I need a tool box to keep all the tools like pliers, hammers, saws, screw drivers etc., I went for this one among the so many listed on Amazon. Although, the box is bigger than what I expected, no regrets. It is very sturdy and attractive looking. Makes the tool area so much organised."

'B0769HL9DL','Taparia Box reveiw','1.0 out of 5 stars','Does not hold much. Width of the lower part of the is much lesser because it is tapered inwards. This reduces the carrying capacity very much. Also the depth of the container is much less. In short it is not value for money.'
