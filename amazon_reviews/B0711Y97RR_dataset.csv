'B0711Y97RR','No Rust protection.','1.0 out of 5 stars',"Hi, I purchased this to fix small issues around my house, and this is honestly the worst purchase I have ever made. The tools got wet after fixing some plumbing-related issues (just a few drops here and there). I left the took kit open, assuming the water would dry off as it's just small drops. But to my surprise, the tools had rust forming on them the next morning.  I understand if rust builds up after a few days in moisture, but this happened within 1 week of purchase. I don't know if there's a better kit, but you should not waste your money here."
