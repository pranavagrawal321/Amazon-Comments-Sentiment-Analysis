'B0B75TVZZZ','Black screen... Watch not starting :( after few months of use','1.0 out of 5 stars',"After only a few months of using this device, I encountered a frustrating issue: a black screen rendering it completely unresponsive. I attempted to revive it by holding the button on the side, but unfortunately, that did not resolve the problem. Despite searching online, I couldn't find any information on how to fix this seemingly common issue.  Given the price I paid, I had higher expectations regarding its durability and lifespan. At this point, I'm left with no choice but to request either a refund or a replacement from Fitbit. I will provide updates on the outcome, but for now, I can only give it a one-star rating."
'B0B75TVZZZ','Black screen of death?','1.0 out of 5 stars',"In just a few months of using this, got a black screen and it's totally dead. Tried resetting it by holding the button on the side, but that does not fit it. Couldn't find information on reviving this online, although it seems to be a common proble... I had expected to get a few years out of this for the price charged. Need either my money back or a replacement from fitbit. Will update on what happened, giving it 1 star for now."
'B0B75TVZZZ','One of the worst smart watches ever','1.0 out of 5 stars',"The media could not be loaded. This is unnecessary hype product it has nothing good to be called smartwatch just because the sensor it has . this watch will never connect to your phone you can clearly see in the video the notification bar still buffers it will never connect to your phone please buy a 5000 cheap watch if you have to but not this one, complete waste of money you don't get watch faces you cannot edit anything from the watch what is the use of a smartwatch then if everything I have to do it from my phone."
'B0B75TVZZZ','Wrong Step Count. Incorrect Zone minutes','1.0 out of 5 stars','Versa 4 counts steps even if just shake the arm wearing the watch while we are just sitting.  Yesterday I was driving my car and did not di any exercises but Versa 4 reported as if I have done 451 minutes of intensive exercises..  This also happened a couple of more times. Looks like while driving Firbit Versa 4 thinks as if we are sprinting.  Very disappointed. Now the return window of Amazon is also over. Hope Fitbit team helps me fix this at the earliest or replace this with another products which works better.'
'B0B75TVZZZ','Sync not proper','1.0 out of 5 stars','Sync is not proper. Left button of watch is stuck and not working. No customer support. I bought this watch on Aug 24th 2023and September 4th 2023 it started showing problems. Return window has closed.'

'B0B75TVZZZ','Never buy Fitbit in India - Recycle once it stops','1.0 out of 5 stars','I had sense & inspire watches worth 28k & both stopped working after 2 years. Fitbit support team bluntly told me to recycle!! It is better to buy BoAt products as they are Made In India & cheaper. We should ban Fitbit from India!! I will never ever buy it.'

'B0B75TVZZZ','Looks good but very inaccurate health stats','2.0 out of 5 stars','I owned a versa 2 which was very good and it lasted 5 years. So I bought this one after the versa 2 stopped working. This one looks nice but is very inaccurate. Even after intense exercise i shows normal heart beat. Seems like a degradation from versa 2.'
'B0B75TVZZZ','Good Pick','4.0 out of 5 stars','Good Product with all the features working as expected by Fitbit. If your buying for iPhone, app will give you so much trouble in connecting to mobile, sending notifications and receiving call on smart watch, but works fine in Android mobiles.'

Battery life for me is 5 days which is superb and it charges really fast too!'
'B0B75TVZZZ','Battery performance down in 3 months','1.0 out of 5 stars','Battery is running only for 2 days. Its supposed to run for 7 days. The most painful part is there is no service centre or proper support available for warranty support. Spending 18000 with least warranty support is pathetic'

'B0B75TVZZZ','Unintuitive hard to use','1.0 out of 5 stars','Absolutely unintuitive interface. Not worth the price. Products priced quarter of this are easier to use. App is also very badly designed . Any time I want to do ANYTHING I have to do a Google search!!!'

'B0B75TVZZZ','Not worth it !!!','2.0 out of 5 stars',"This is one product that is exorbitantly price and extremely inaccurate. Every time you swing the watch hand, it adds steps. If you ride a motorcycle, it assumes a bicycle workout. The pulse reading is off by a few points. The oxy meter said 124 while the watch read 110. The app doesn't support some of the features on Android 13. I contacted the developer team and they reassured me that a new version will sort things out but that too hasn't helped. My advice: BUY SOMETHING CHEAPER THAT IS MORE ACCURATE. I had some cheaper ones that were more accurate like the OnePlus. The strap is not great in that."

Since i wasn't upgrading any fitbit device I'm new to the fitbit community i went on with the latest buy versa 4. Gotta say I'm impressed so far. It mostly suits me for helping me change my sleeping routine which is very basic need but i used to suck at it!. Making the sleep patterns so accurate and in visual graphics make it easier for me to understand my sleep and how my body responds.

'B0B75TVZZZ','FITBIT CUSTOMERS BEWARE','1.0 out of 5 stars',"Beware, Fitbit does not have a service centre and if ur watch battery drains out and refuses to take charge after a couple of years (as happened with my earlier Versa), u will have to throw it away. Also, local technicians are unable to repair. Feature wise it's a shame for the money charged. FITBIT PL WAKE UP BEFORE ITS TOO LATE.."
'B0B75TVZZZ','From 8 years of being a loyal Fitbit fan to terminating my account with Fitbit','1.0 out of 5 stars','Better avoid this and go for alternates, please ensure you check if they have Service Centre\'s in your region before purchase.  I was a Fitbit customer, based in India. My relationship with Fitbit started in 2014 with Surge, loved the product and used for almost six years. Replaced the old Surge with a new one when it started to malfunction. Never dreamt of changing the device. Surge was perfect.  In 2020, I upgraded to Versa 2, the latest then and things continued good. The issue started when I wanted to upgrade to Fitbit Sense 2. I wanted to wipe the data in Versa 2 before giving it to my family members.  Hit the Factory reset option to clear the data, but the Versa 2 suddenly stopped responding. It refused to charge nor switch on after the Factory reset was hit. Promptly reached out to the Fitbit support team to get this repaired. After multiple email interaction, this is what I understood.  There are no service centres for Fitbit in India. They replace faulty products only within warranty period, which is 1 year from the date of purchase. If any issue arises post 1 year, there is no support for the device.  As a user, rarely one would go for factory reset once the device has been activated. It\'s either done if the data is not reading correct or if you are giving it to others. This normally doesn\'t happen with the year of purchase. There is very less opportunity to check if the device is faulty due to "Factory Reset" within the first year of purchase.  Finally email from Fitbit support team  "Thank you for letting us know about your recent experience with our product and I appreciate you taking time to share your concerns. We understand your situation. However, we have a warranty policy that we need to follow. Once again, we do apologize if we\'re unable to replace it. "  My suggestion to all future buyers, please be weary of the fact that there is no service centre in India if you encounter any problem with device. You spend more than 20K and after 1 year you might be left high and dry, should you encounter device issues.'
'B0B75TVZZZ','Perfect tracker by Fitbit.','5.0 out of 5 stars','Only drawback is that even though being a google product , yet it houses Alexa voice assistant. Rest assured , this is a good buy. Go for the Waterfall Blue band.'
