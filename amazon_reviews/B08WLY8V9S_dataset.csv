'B08WLY8V9S','Feels great, very comfortable!','5.0 out of 5 stars','The media could not be loaded. Well, I have used it now just for a day, but I feel this shall last a long time! The make is really sturdy, and the foam padding, just perfect; not too cushy, not too hard; just the right balance between hard and soft, to make your elbow alignment feel as perfect as it could get. The anti-slid feature really works, I mean, it works too well!! If I want to shift the mousepad by a fraction of an inch, I am unable to push it ... however, it also means that while I am working, it shall never shift on its own. I think I made a good investment.'
