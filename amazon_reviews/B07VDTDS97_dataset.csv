'B07VDTDS97','Not worth for money .. wasted on 4 months','1.0 out of 5 stars','The capacity of the bottle to keep the water hot for 24 hours stopped after 3 months usage and the customer service never got connected to claim for Guarantee. Total disappointment. Waste of money and energy.'

'B07VDTDS97','Very bad customer support','1.0 out of 5 stars',"The bottle's capacity to keep the water hot stopped working after 2 months' use even though it was handled so very gently and the customer service doesn't even get connected to claim for Guarantee. Total disappointment. Not trust worthy."
'B07VDTDS97','Good','4.0 out of 5 stars','Good thing about this bottle is that- I have been using this bottle for so long like nearly 2 years is going to complete. It is very study. It fell down so many times but there is no effect on this bottle. No complaint on the material.  However, may be because of falling down for so many times, it has stopped working to preserve the water cold/hot. If we put cold water, it will hardly work for 4 hours approx. So, if you are only buying for normal water use, then you should buy. Other than that, I am not able to recommend to purchase this bottle.'

'B07VDTDS97','Pathetic Quality','1.0 out of 5 stars','The flask will not withstand even a small dent of the size of the matchstick head. The customer care is also adamant in rejecting the warranty claims due to these small dents that is not even visible in a casual look.

Firstly it doesn't serve the purpose of heat retention which I can not expect water inside to be hot after 3 to 4 hours. Secondly its not dishwashers safe. I always see scales on the rim and give me headache while cleaning manually. Thirdly, the cap design should have been better. After few weeks of usage, the holder broke and came off, ever since it is leaking. And last but the most irritating thing is, unlike my cello, the rim is of worst design I can not pour properly"
