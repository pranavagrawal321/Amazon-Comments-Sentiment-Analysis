'B0BY8L3RZ6','Honest opinion after using months','3.0 out of 5 stars',"Everything except below mentioned issues works well. The display is so poor that it doesn't even support higher resolution than 1080p in YouTube . They've made this with 200mp sensor but doesn't even record videos higher than FHD, which below 10K phones used to do back in the days but the clicks are not so boring. They never cared to put a mesh or anything in the front speaker which goes beside the ears while calling, it's a wide long hollow part. There're few restrictions in the software as mentioned above in case of video recording and display outputs. Don't be fooled by the so called brand value."
