'B072MVS3BW','Not worth for the money','1.0 out of 5 stars','Product is of very low quality that it doesnot even expand for one size large than my original size.

'B072MVS3BW','Points to keep in mind before purchasing','2.0 out of 5 stars',"Purchase at least two sizes bigger for comfort size. The item is slippery so you may feel uncomfortable. Rest, lookwise it's good"
'B072MVS3BW','Pretty, shiny and comfy !','4.0 out of 5 stars',"Beautiful maroon colour ; lovely shimmer as expected ; wore it for 9 hrs at a stretch n was quite comfy overall except the waist, where the elastic could've been a bit more relaxed n comfy but could bear n pull off the day inspite of the summer season .  The legging does show signs of stretching at the stitching after 1st long full day wear ... not sure if the stiching will give way n will need repair soon ... time will tell ...  It looks like it will last decent no of wears if I wear it sparingly ..  Will reco it for its comfort n shimmer !"

'B072MVS3BW','Good but...','4.0 out of 5 stars','I liked the product so I am using it on regular basis.
