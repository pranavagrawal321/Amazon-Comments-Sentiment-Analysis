No compatible source was found for this media. We\'ve bought the product in the trust of milton brand but it was worst  1. The mop lock didn\'t worked properly if you give a mild pressure while cleaning it will open, the lock keeps on opening and the mop handle slips to the bottom (3rd image)  So we\'ve replaced it and got an another one But again.....  2. You can see it the video the mop not spinning properly, it strucks and produces sound.  3. It was way too small but somehow ok , if you\'re having a big space then you need to change water frequently  4. During the replacement we\'ve got a already used product, there\'s some scratches and hair in the mop while taking it out of the box  During the purchase had a confusion between buying Scotch brite and milton, bought milton as we already had some good impression with milton products'
