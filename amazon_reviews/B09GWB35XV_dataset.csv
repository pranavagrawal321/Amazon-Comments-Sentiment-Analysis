'B09GWB35XV','Nice for everyday use.','5.0 out of 5 stars','You will have to tinker fair bit on the options for getting the optimal setting; however, once you have locked on them , the display works great. Like the slim and smooth design. The edges are not too thick. Great for everyday use, including office and heavy programming. Not for gamers. Also the LG app that splits the screen in different formats is a power hog and can considerably slowdown your CPU, so avoid using it.'
'B09GWB35XV','One of the best monitors for beginners on a budget','4.0 out of 5 stars','After a calibrating the display was just simply amazing. Beautiful colour reproduction as well as decent viewing angles. Not gonna complain for a display on an 8k budget. Here are a few things to note: * The monitor caps at 1080P 75 Hz * sharpness is not great, but also not so bad at the same time. * has only one HDMI input so please invest on an HDMI splitter. * The monitor has a 3.5mm port as well as ports for a VESA mount.'
'B09GWB35XV','Not so good','3.0 out of 5 stars','The video quality, look is good, customisation is also good but for gaming not so good. The 75hz display is not so right for playing games. And also more companies provides us 144hz display is this prise. Not good for gaming or any fast movement work. I suggest you to go for other monitor for gaming'

'B09GWB35XV','Bought a dell monitor 2 years before this LG monitor and the dell still works while LG does not','2.0 out of 5 stars','I bought a dell monitor in Oct 2018: https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B07436JM87/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1  I bought this LG monitor in Jan 2020. It has stopped working in April 2023 while the Dell monitor is still going strong. When I say stopped working, it is constantly flickering and has weird lines all over the screen. I believe that the Dell monitor was 4k cheaper. Taking that comparison into account, I believe that this monitor has severely underdelivered in terms of how long it has lasted. In terms of picture quality, both monitors were good enough for my use case. Perhaps the LG had marginally better picture quality than the Dell one but hard to tell and both anyway met my minimum requirement.'
'B09GWB35XV','the height is too low','3.0 out of 5 stars','the height of the monitor is not suitable for long hours working, ending your head all times gives headache. Otherwise amazon service, packaging as well as the product were good'
'B09GWB35XV','Good quality','4.0 out of 5 stars','Really super to work for photoshop editing and video editing. Colour correction and colour grading result is good. But the monitor has volume option and there is no inbuilt speaker.'
