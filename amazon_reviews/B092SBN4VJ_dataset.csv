The Wrench: The wrench is a crescent/Adjustable wrench meaning, it comes with an adjustable jaw which allows it to be used with different sizes of fastener head (nut, bolt, etc.) rather than just one fastener size, as with a conventional fixed spanner.  The Plier: Its solidly built and provide stronger grip than the general plier you find in the market.  The Hammer: Like the rest of the tools the hammer also quite strongly built the rare is slightly longer than the other hammers you find in the market, which makes it easier to remove the nails. The head is also quite strong and slightly smaller which provides an additional on point force making it easier to stroke nails into the walls.  The measuring Tape: Its a Long stylish measuring Tap, which comes with a temporary hold button(The you have to press and hold to keep the tape from going anywhere) and a permanent hold button(That you'll just have to push down to hold the tape for a longer time, comes in handy when there is only a single person taking the measurement).  In summary: All the 5 different tools provided in the kit are quite good quality products that are not only functional but stylish as well."
