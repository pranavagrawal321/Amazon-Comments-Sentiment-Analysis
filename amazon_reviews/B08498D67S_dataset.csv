'B08498D67S','Bad quality','1.0 out of 5 stars',"Very bad quality. I have bought 3 or 4 pieces previously and were of good quality. Now, the standard has gone down the drain. Very hard keys, If you use it for 4-5 hours, your fingers will start screaming. springs used in the space bar are tension less and often the space bar jams in between. If you return the item, you will get same type of item in return. I have two brand new items with me, one has very dim background light and one with hard keys. If you go to a HP service point to get an exchange, It will take at least one month and at least 3 visits to get a replacement and as I said earlier, the replacements are also bad. My Rs 2300 gone down the drain. HP, I really didn't expect it from you."

'B08498D67S','Looks amazing','5.0 out of 5 stars',"I bought a mechanical keyboard towards the beginning of this year. And I finally swallowed the bitter pill and admit that this membrane keyboard is 100 times better than a mechanical one. Mechanical keyboards are very high maintenance and a few keys had double and triple typing issues (even after rigorous cleaning). That's why I went back to a membrane keyboard."

'B08498D67S','awesome keyboard. strong and sturdy','4.0 out of 5 stars',"I picked this up for the double injection mould, and not the fancy lighting.

But I trust hp products and hope it'll bring me joy and comfort working."
'B08498D67S','MORE VALUE for MONEY','4.0 out of 5 stars',"It looks really good. Trust me , the looks n' in hand feel is way better than what it seems in the pictures. The aluminium top gives it a very premium looks. Key travel and the clicking sound it makes it really smooth, better than what other companies are offering at this price point.  On top of all that it has 3 year of warranty. What more can you ask from a rs.900 keyboard.  In Short, don't overthinking,go for it. ‚ú®  Tl;dr : Buy a wrist rest if you guys can. It improves the ergonomics."
