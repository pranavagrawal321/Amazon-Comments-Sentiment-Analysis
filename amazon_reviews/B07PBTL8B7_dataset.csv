'B07PBTL8B7','Cheap glass product','1.0 out of 5 stars','The quality of glass is really to be seen. No wonder i got this product so cheap, was wondering why it could be so cheap. The quality of glass is really third class. You see the distortion and unevenness all around. Not sure if it will take hot water without cracking. As opposed to other reliable brands you can see the quality difference. If you want something cheap and easy to get hold of, then go for this.'

'B07PBTL8B7','Cheap, sturdy and serves the purpose','5.0 out of 5 stars',"Well the product is cheap compared to other branded bottles, it's super thick and sturdy, it fell once out of my hand from above 2 get height and bounced right off the ground and luckily it didn't break, so it's sturdy. But because of thickness it's quite heavy to carry around. Cleaning is also a bit difficult with bottle brush because of the tiny head. I just use boiling water and vim liquid to rinse it and it does the job"
