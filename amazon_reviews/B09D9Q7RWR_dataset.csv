'B09D9Q7RWR','Looks good; pathetic paint finish','3.0 out of 5 stars','Looks sturdy and string. Feels spacious by the look. But when I ran my palm lightly to remove dust, the paint is peeling off as pieces of still layers. Not sure how long the paint will stay. Raising a return request.'
'B09D9Q7RWR','Sturdy product good packing','5.0 out of 5 stars','Sturdy sufficiently large for tools , ordered Durelo D33 and was disappointed with the packing so opted for plantex .few hundred rupees costly . Nevertheless worth the few hundred rupees. For locking there is just a hole in the lid through which a pad lock can be placed a locking mechanism would have been excellent .two handles instead of one is a plus .handles move out of the way and does not interfere with transfer of tools. Thank you plantex I had ordered tool box from Goodyear too had to return it as the product was very poorly designed with gaps between the comparments .handles getting inbetween the way .comparments open only half way . Good year was a disappointment .so was Durelo ..it had dents on delivery .but it was better than good year. ordered plantex for the second time .AMAZING PRODUCT PLANTEX !!! two handles that stay out of the way .packing was excellent care ensured that there will be no damage .nice paint and finish . Thickness of the metal used is also better than Durelo and Goodyear. Kudos plantex. Keep it up .'

'B09D9Q7RWR','Too good','4.0 out of 5 stars','The tool box is well built. Too well built. I think only for professionals not for seldom user. As the box is well built it is heavy and with tools it becomes really heavy. No dent when received. Paint is also looks good. Packaging was good for iron box. Price is on higher side. Hand drill machine can be put on the bottom compartment. My suggestion- if you are buying for your own home tools purposes with limited movement then may opt for cheaper option. Overall very good product with higher price bracket.'
