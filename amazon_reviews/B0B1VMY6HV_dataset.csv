'B0B1VMY6HV','Only for the fair skinned','3.0 out of 5 stars',"My hunt for a nice purple eyeliner continues. The brand is good. I have highly sensative skin so I avoid most beauty products. This one has suits me just fine. However the color is not dark or bright. It will look good on very very fair skinned people. It was barely visible on mine and it probably won't even show on dark skin. If it had glitter atleast it would be more visible but this liner, of this particular color, falls flat. Or barely visible. Almost like a natural lip colour."
