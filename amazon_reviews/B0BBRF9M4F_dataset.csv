'B0BBRF9M4F','Not a gaming monitor','4.0 out of 5 stars','It is a TFT display, the colors have a slight yellow tinge(might be purposeful by design to reduce blue light).

You can see tester light up on hdmi cable in my pic. Plugging this into a mbp results in an energized case that will shock you. If you have a 3 pin connector on the laptop it will be used as the grounding bus. Dunno how I feel about the much more expensive laptop being used as the grounding connection for my screens.'

This dynamic duo has significantly enhanced my overall user experience, both for work and leisure.  One of my favorite aspects of the MSI Modern 14 is its powerful performance. With the i7 processor, it effortlessly handles multitasking, making my work tasks smooth and efficient. Whether I'm working on demanding spreadsheets or editing graphics, this laptop delivers beyond my expectations, and I can complete tasks much faster.  The business monitor, at 24 inches, is just the right size for my workspace. The crisp display and vibrant colors make every document and image come to life. It's a game-changer for my productivity, allowing me to work with precision and clarity.  One of the main reasons I chose the MSI Modern 14 and this particular monitor was their reputation for reliability and performance. MSI has a track record of producing high-quality laptops, and this one is no exception. The monitor, too, has proven to be a reliable companion, with no issues whatsoever.  What sets this combo apart is its ability to fulfill my diverse needs. Whether it's for professional work, watching movies, or gaming during my downtime, it excels in every aspect.

It's also surprisingly quiet, which is a big plus during video conferences. As for the monitor, its sharp display and adjustable stand are definite strengths.  However, there are minimal weaknesses, such as the laptop's webcam quality, which could be improved. Nevertheless, this doesn't significantly impact my overall satisfaction with the product.  In conclusion, the MSI Modern 14 i7 laptop and the 24-inch business monitor have been a winning combination for me.
