'B0BNL3ZHSQ','Cannot trust the diaper size','3.0 out of 5 stars','I had been buying Solimo Large from April onwards and found it good. But this time particular order of 60 Solimo Adult diapers Large, is not like the ones that I had bought previously. I use this for a super senior citizen at home and she finds that it is not covering the groins well as it used to. Even the tab length is shorter, absorption is so poor that it spreads all over the bed. My doubt is that a smaller size is marked Large and packed. Kindly look into it. I trusted Solimo as it is Amazon product, now I will have to think twice before I order.'
