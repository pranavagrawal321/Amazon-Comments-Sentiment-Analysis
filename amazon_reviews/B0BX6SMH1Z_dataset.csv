'B0BX6SMH1Z','Shock marta hain','1.0 out of 5 stars','I ordered this from Portronics official site. Started electrocuting my metal Laptop (I use it sometimes in PD mode when laptop charger is far away)... So I checked and found that it was giving shock to touch too.  Returned to Portronics (shipping cost almost = actual product cost) and they shipped replacement, which worked fine for 1-2 months and again same issues started.  Refer to pics.  (Not a problem with cable/source as it is happening everywhere and not to other charging bricks)'

'B0BX6SMH1Z','Absolutely Horrendous Product and Service!','1.0 out of 5 stars',"I recently purchased the Portronics Adapto 70 33W Fast Wall Charging Adapter, and I must say that it has been nothing short of a complete disaster! To put it bluntly, this product is a steaming pile of garbage, and the seller's response to my issue has only added to my embarrassment.  First of all, the adapter stopped working after just 20 days of use. Yes, you read that right â€“ 20 days! I expected a product from a supposedly reputable brand like Portronics to last longer than a couple of weeks. It's not like I was using it to power a small nuclear reactor; I was just charging my phone!  Now, let's talk about the seller's response. It was as embarrassing as it gets. When I reached out to them to complain about the faulty product, they acted like I was trying to scam them out of a million dollars. It took days for them to respond to my initial message, and when they finally did, they asked for every piece of information under the sun, including the product's serial number, my purchase receipt, and even a blood sample (okay, maybe not the blood sample, but you get the idea).  After jumping through all these hoops and providing the required information, they had the audacity to blame me for the product's failure, suggesting that I must have mishandled it or used it incorrectly. Excuse me, but I've been plugging things into outlets for years without any issues, thank you very much!  A Note from seller :- Note - We work with a carry-in warranty policy, we don't have an onsite/pickup service. Courier charges are non-refundable by the company.  You need to pay Courier charges from your own pocket and its your choice to go with this Brand in the name of MADE IN INDIA.  To make matters worse, they refused to offer a refund or a replacement, leaving me stuck with a useless piece of junk and a gaping hole in my wallet. So, not only did I waste my money on a defective product, but I also had to endure the humiliation of dealing with a seller who clearly has no regard for customer satisfaction.  In conclusion, I wouldn't wish this product or the seller's pathetic customer service on my worst enemy. Save yourself the embarrassment and avoid the Portronics Adapto 70 33W Fast Wall Charging Adapter at all costs. You'll thank me later!"

'B0BX6SMH1Z','Decent','3.0 out of 5 stars','The bonus is two ports. The disappointment is that the cable doesnâ€™t plug in at one go. You would have to adjust it in a certain way for it to charge your device. I am used to the apple charger where it charges your device as soon as you plug it in. Sometimes, Iâ€™ll put it on charge only to later find out that it hasnâ€™t been charging.'

'B0BX6SMH1Z','Does not provide rated power','1.0 out of 5 stars','Purchased this product after validating that it works for Macbook Air 13". Received the product and tested it for two days, it worked fine. Ordered another product 2 days later as backup (when on travel). Used the product intermittently & today while on business travel, I used the adapter & to my surprise both the adapters are not charging the laptop. Apparently, the return window expired on 29 Aug and 2 Sep. I dunno, whether Portronics will own this and send two 33W adapters as replacements.  Refer image for clarity. Have captured the timestamp too.  Note: I am using an original "C type" cable that came with my Macbook Air laptop adapter.'
