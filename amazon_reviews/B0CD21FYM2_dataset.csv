'B0CD21FYM2','"Product Quality is Good, but Packaging for Gift Needs Improvement"','1.0 out of 5 stars',"I recently purchased this product as a gift for my mom, and I have to express my disappointment with the packaging. I had added a gift card and paid extra for it, expecting a beautifully wrapped package. However, the item arrived in a regular courier packaging, which was not what I had anticipated. This was quite frustrating üò°. On a positive note, the product itself is good, and I'm satisfied with its quality üëçüèª. But the packaging experience left me somewhat dissatisfied."

'B0CD21FYM2','Average FM Radio. Buy wisely!','3.0 out of 5 stars',"I wanted to buy a handy radio and came across this device. Had to return the first purchase as the Mode Button was not working and got a replacement. Even the replacement device is not giving good quality radio experience indoors. Maybe limitation of a Digital Radio. Otherwise, as a Bluetooth Speaker it's fine (limited bass). A good value for money but would have been better if Radio clarity was up to the mark."

Reception quality on FM is not good even with antenna.'

'B0CD21FYM2','A top notch product but with a glitch!!!','4.0 out of 5 stars',"Excellent product with amazing sound quality both in FM mode as well as in Sd.. But i am facing a problem in this product and the problem is that whenever it's battery reaches less than 50 percent there is continues warning sound that comes out of this radio... It's a kind of annoying that it will warn you after every 10- 15 seconds about battery low unless you will charge it. Low battery warning sound should be there but it should not be like that it will warn you in every second and if it's really necessary then it should there only if battery goes down to 10 percent not of 50 percent...I really don't know whether it's a glitch with my device only or it's a manufacturing defect Rest everything is good!!!"
