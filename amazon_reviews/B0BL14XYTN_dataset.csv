'B0BL14XYTN','Ok Ok Product. Not Aristocrat level that I expected.','3.0 out of 5 stars','Design is nice. Surface looks good when It’s new. One travel and the surface starts rubbing off to give an ugly look. Chain is single locking which doesn’t locks properly if it’s not align. My VIP is double chain with perfect closing.'

'B0BL14XYTN','Looks are good but quality is very poor','2.0 out of 5 stars','In looks it is fantastic but if we talk about its quality, it runs out of the competition. Not up to the mark in such a price range. Its handles are so weak that it seems it will break in pushing heavy luggage. I have returned it back to the seller. Not recommended.'

'B0BL14XYTN','Zipper & Lock Quality is poor','1.0 out of 5 stars',"Made with low-quality materials. The zipper of 68cm back broke down at the airport and the lock of 55cm luggage didn't open. So we have to dump them and buy new luggage on our trip. My advice would be to not buy Kamilant's luggage."
'B0BL14XYTN','Nice for cabin luggage','5.0 out of 5 stars','The self weight of this bag is negligible so perfect for cabin...'
