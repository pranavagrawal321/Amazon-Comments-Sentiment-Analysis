'B0CHJ4LQGV','Not good enough','2.0 out of 5 stars','I regret buying this phone. The processor is not fast enough, apps or chats on whatsapp take 1-2 seconds to open. At 208 grams, it is 40% heavier than my old vivo phone and I can feel its weight in my pocket. Apparently this is 120hz amoled but it is no better than my 5 Yr old vivo. I am starting to think we will not get the best value for money if we avoid Chinese brands.'
'B0CHJ4LQGV','Buy only for your dad or mom','3.0 out of 5 stars',"All YouTube reviews are fake. They all get paid for it  Pros  Let's First talk about camera and screen the main highlights of screen They all appreciated camera alot but it's not even close to hype gives yellowish tone to each photo like a cheap smartphone not eyepleasing at all Display is good acc to price but you can tell the difference only when put side to side with another smartphone otherwise all display gives similar view in this price range So not worth buying only for display  Now price i bought it for 15000 So I should be comparing it with other 15000rs smartphones but not you should go for Smartphone around 17000 because 15000‚Çπ for smartphone + 1500 for charger + 200 cover and screen guard= 16700 ( other brands give all this with smartphone)  So all the best things about this phone camera display price , in actual are not that good all this is gimmick so only buy this phone for your parents who doesn't have long screentime as it has big battery, 4 years of updates  Cons Took 2 hours too charge that's is way too long Processor is not that good as you already know Not worth the price there are better option in less price Ugly drop notch chin ( though Mobile looks good you may call somewhat premium if chin is ignored)  If you are getting this with charger under 15k and not that fond of gaming and whitish photos ( pictures that makes you look fair) then you can go for it"
