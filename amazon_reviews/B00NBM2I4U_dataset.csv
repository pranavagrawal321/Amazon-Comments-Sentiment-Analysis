'B00NBM2I4U','Very minimal microfibre threads. Looks cheap','1.0 out of 5 stars',"Though the pictures of this product makes it look like a heavily threaded mop head in reality it hardly has 6-8 threads and couple of flat threads or fabric. Don't know why the manufactured it this way since this doesn't capture all dirt in one go. We need to keep pushing and rubbing it multiple times on the same spot to clean the floor properly.  Practically not a good product. Should have double the number of threads."
