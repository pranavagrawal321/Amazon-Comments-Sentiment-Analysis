'B0BYZ46VNK','Not worth the price , Bad sound quality','1.0 out of 5 stars','The sound quality is very bad for a ‚Çπ1700 BT speaker that too from Boat. Highly disappointed by this product. Its weight is also heavy and size is not portable as it looks. Better go for a chinese speaker that will cost you not more than ‚Çπ500. I expected not best but atleast a better sound quality as i have other Boat products. First time Boat has disappointed me. Looks like they have just focused on the designing and branding and not on the sound quality.'

'B0BYZ46VNK','Great Speakers Boat.','5.0 out of 5 stars',"I've been using them for about an hour and I'm absolutely amazed by the Boat Stone 352. It's more than loud for its size and has a good bass response. The bass does get muddled at max volume and I'd recommend not running bass heavy songs on this speaker at the max volume. It's an awesome purchase and there is no competition at the price point. Great to see an Indian brand making such great speakers that can rival foreign brands.üôåüèΩ"

'B0BYZ46VNK',"Totally dissapointed with the brand name 'boat' product",'2.0 out of 5 stars',"I purchased it after seeing the brand name. But I am bound to say what disastrous decision I have made. I have to send it three times to customer service. Still, I am having a problem. The demerit of this speaker is the Bluetooth cannot be connected to the laptop. It only connects with the mobile. So if you are a heavy user of a laptop like me, please don't go for it."
