'B0BGRZQMTM','Quality but very less quantity','3.0 out of 5 stars',"First of all fragrance is good not irritating, yes it looks fruity type fragrance. Cons: quantity seems to be very less. Spray nozzle is not covered so might be it is used which make it cheaper product. Dent on body not giving new look. I think company need to be work that atleast spray nozzle is covered and customer open it. So that it didn't feel it is used product"

Going to try the other variant in this series...'
