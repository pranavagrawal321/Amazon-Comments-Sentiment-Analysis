'B0BP2M7CCS','Never buying any electronic devices from hp','1.0 out of 5 stars',"The Laptop stopped working after 2 months of mild use I had to repair it on my own cuz hp cust didn't respond at all it cost me 2k they had to do reballing and they removed RAM chip as well. Now my laptop is without RAM i'll have to buy RAM on my own now. I invested all my savings in this laptop for my studies. I belong to lower middle-class family. Poor hardware quality of this laptop was nightmare to me. It gave me anxiety. And I still worry if it'll stop again. My parents are blaming me for buying costly laptop which didn't even run 2 months properly. As a girl the amount of money hit me hard. This was 1st laptop in my family. I fooled by hp brand name. Please go for better than this. Fans start noise after 5 min of use. Battery performance is poor. Fiber body is weak. hp you did wrong to me. I'm never trusting you ever again"
