'B01M72LILF','Logitech M221 Wireless Mouse: Budget-Friendly but Short-Lived','3.0 out of 5 stars',"The Logitech M221 Wireless Mouse initially impressed with its comfort, responsive tracking, and easy setup. However, it's disappointing that the scroll wheel stopped working after just 6 months of use, especially considering my previous one died after only 4 months.

'B01M72LILF','Perfect responsive mouse','5.0 out of 5 stars','Wireless mouse has to be Logitech.'
'B01M72LILF','Awesome','5.0 out of 5 stars','I earlier had a logi mouse and that was supposed to be silent. This is even better than that with smooth clicks and neat movement. Only concern is that the ligh indicator does not seem to be working. Will be a hassle when battery needs to be changed. Other than that an excellent product someone who uses mouse extensively'
'B01M72LILF','Started giving issues within 7 months','3.0 out of 5 stars','Cursor movement became slow, it is not moving properly.'
'B01M72LILF','mouse not working','1.0 out of 5 stars','with just 10 days, mouse is not working and return window is closed. what should i do now?'
'B01M72LILF','Right click stopped working after 5 months.','2.0 out of 5 stars','Kindly do not buy this product. I am a teacher at a private school. I used this for 2-3 hours daily. But after 5 months, the right click stopped working. Moreover, the "feel" of the product was not good. There is no "click" sensation or sound. You are always left unsatisfied, you won\'t know for certain whether the "click" has happened or not. I would urge you to stay away from this mouse... buy a more expensive model if you want wireless, else at this price range, go for a good quality wired mouse.'
'B01M72LILF','Best silent clicks mouse','5.0 out of 5 stars',"It's been 1 year since I bought this mouse...it is still working fine. Here are some points to be noted: 1. Good design and nicely build 2. Battery life is good ...it is still working on the battery that it came with. 3. After 4-5 times falling from table or bed ...it's still working quite fine. 4. The scrollWheel feels cheap as on scrolling it makes little noise..not a big problem though. 5. It's silent clicks are satisfying."
'B01M72LILF','Average Quality','3.0 out of 5 stars','Although most things are working fine, the USB receiver connection is not so reliable especially on metal laptops like surface laptop 4, where we place USB receiver on left USB port and we use mouse with our right hand. The wireless reception is not strong enough to maintain stability'
'B01M72LILF','NOT USEFUL','1.0 out of 5 stars','An average optical mouse with a higher price. The clicking sound is minimal, but the overall performance and the utility are not great. A major drawback is the scroll wheel, which malfunctioned (in my case) within a month. The right-click button is very sensitive, and little pressure causes right-click action. Not satisfied, I should have gone with the traditional Logitech mouse.'
'B01M72LILF','Good wireless mouse.','5.0 out of 5 stars','Good working mouse. No click sound makes it noise free. Good sensitivity.Value for money.'
'B01M72LILF','Working not upto the mark','3.0 out of 5 stars','Product is not woking after 18 months but there is a 3years warrenty'
