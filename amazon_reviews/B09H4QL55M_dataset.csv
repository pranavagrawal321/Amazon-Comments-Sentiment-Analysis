'B09H4QL55M','Very good','5.0 out of 5 stars',"It's a very heavy fleece blanket in my opinion. Size is very big too despite ordering single sized. Air cnt pass throught it so it will keep warm in winter months and one can even double it for a single person. Value for money"
'B09H4QL55M','Go for it in Winter','4.0 out of 5 stars',"I read some negative reviews about this product but still went ahead and purchased & I am happy that I did. It's soft, it's big enough & it's warm for the current winter season. I see that price has increased by ~25% in just 3 days after I purchased it. It did not smell bad. Although additional packaging could have been better instead of a plastic roll. Overall, I am satisfied with the product.  I must admit that at same price, you can get even better blanket in offline shop but you need time to do that. So go for it if you are looking for something online"

'B09H4QL55M','Bought two of these!','5.0 out of 5 stars','This blanket is a boon during winters, but still breathable.

Purchased these in 2 colours, grape and blue!'

'B09H4QL55M','Warm','5.0 out of 5 stars','Soft blanket'
'B09H4QL55M','Warm and comfortable','5.0 out of 5 stars',"I was sceptical about buying a synthetic blanket because I was afraid of static and the quickly-too-warm feeling, if you know what I mean... but didn't want a cotton Razai because it's cold to the touch initially and only gradually warms up with one's body temperature.  I'm satisfied with this blanket. It's comfortable against the skin and doesn't get uncomfortable warm but is warm enough to improve sleep (Bangalore monsoon cold). Not too heavy, not too light, just right.  Only, the blanket was sent in a huge box in which the blanket was basically rolling around--approx a 3'x2'x2.5' box! It could have been sent in quarter that size."

'B09H4QL55M','A good product.','5.0 out of 5 stars','More warmth would be great. But at this cost it is right and certainly value for money. Regarding durability I have believed on information got during purchase.'
'B09H4QL55M','Buy it !','5.0 out of 5 stars','Worth every rupee spent...... It has everything you may expect from a good quality warmer. Generously sized too.'
'B09H4QL55M','Soft. Warmth. No air inside.','3.0 out of 5 stars','This is good for place with extreme temperature. I live in chennai with moderate cold. I feel like there is zero air circulation inside, kind of suffocating. It protects against any freezing temperature i think. It is soft and i got big size so head n leg both covers without pulling either side. But if you want atleast little air inside like me, then go for some other blanket.'
'B09H4QL55M','Ok','3.0 out of 5 stars','Is not as soft as advertised. Light weight, though.'
