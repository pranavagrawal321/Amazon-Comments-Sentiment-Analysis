The media could not be loaded, either because the server or network failed or because the format is not supported. The liner is perfect as it gives you instant wings. Just stamp it and you got the perfect wings. Pros: It‚Äôs really quick. The colour is jet black. The line is pretty perfect. You also get pen liner on the other side which is pitch black too. Stays for at least 5-6 hours Cons: It‚Äôs not waterproof Tips: I trace over the wings using my Est√©e Lauder waterproof liner. So the wings totally stays!! Totally worth the buy üòä'
