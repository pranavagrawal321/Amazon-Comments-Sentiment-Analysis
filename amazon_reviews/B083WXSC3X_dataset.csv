'B083WXSC3X','Same fragrance but diminished quality.','3.0 out of 5 stars',"I've been buying this for a while. But this time the quality has diminished drastically. The longevity isn't more than a couple of hours in humid conditions, which used to be 12+ hours earlier for the exact same product.  I think I'll just have to switch back to NIVEA Fresh Protect."

'B083WXSC3X','This deodorant is utterly disappointing','1.0 out of 5 stars',"it reeks of nothing but alcohol. The overpowering stench of alcohol lingers until it finally dissipates, leaving you with no discernible fragrance whatsoever. Save your money and steer clear of this product. The promised scent only emerges once the alcohol odor vanishes, but with this deodorant, there's no scent to be found."

'B083WXSC3X','Disappointing Experience - Old Spice Lionpride No Gas Deodorant Body Spray','1.0 out of 5 stars','I recently purchased the Old Spice Lionpride No Gas Deodorant Body Spray Perfume for Men, 140ml from Amazon, and I must say, it turned out to be one of the most disappointing purchases I\'ve made. The product fell far short of my expectations and left me thoroughly dissatisfied.  Firstly, the fragrance itself was underwhelming. The Lionpride variant, which promises a bold and captivating scent, turned out to be quite the opposite. The fragrance was faint and seemed to vanish within minutes of application, leaving me wondering if I had even sprayed it on. The lack of longevity was truly disappointing, as I expected a product from a reputable brand like Old Spice to deliver a lasting and appealing scent.  Furthermore, the "no gas" claim seemed dubious at best. The spray mechanism emitted more of a mist than a proper spray, making it difficult to evenly distribute the product. This resulted in uneven coverage and left me feeling like I had to use more than I should to achieve any noticeable effect.  In conclusion, my experience with the Old Spice Lionpride No Gas Deodorant Body Spray Perfume for Men was highly disappointing. The lacklustre fragrance, poor longevity, and overall subpar quality make this product a regrettable purchase. I hope this review serves as a cautionary tale for others considering this product. It\'s safe to say that I won\'t be repurchasing this particular variant and will be wary of Old Spice\'s offerings in the future.'
